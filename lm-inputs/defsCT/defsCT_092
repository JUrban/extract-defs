Definition 13.4. Let us call a model category $\mathcal{A}$ a model category of $(\infty,n)$-categories if its underlying quasicategory $\mathrm{N}^{\mathrm{H}}\mathcal{A}$ is a homotopy theory of $(\infty,n)$-categories.
Definition 3.1. A strict $n$-category $X$ is gaunt if $X$ is local with respect to the functor $\sigma^{k-1}E\to\sigma^{k-1}(\ast)=C_{k-1}$, that is, the following natural map is a bijection, $\operatorname{Cat}_{k}(C_{k-1},X)\to\operatorname{Cat}_{k}(\sigma^{k-1}E,X).$ Equivalently, for any $k\leq n$, the only invertible $k$-morphisms of $X$ are the identities.
Definition 5.6. The category $\Upsilon_{n}$ is the smallest full subcategory of $\operatorname{Gaunt}_{n}$ containing the globular category $\mathbb{G}_{n}$ of cells that is closed under retracts and fiber products over cells, $(X,Y)\mapsto X\times_{C_{k}}Y$.
Definition 12.1 ([1]). Let $\operatorname{CSS}(\Delta^{0})$ be the quasicategory $\mathcal{S}$ of Kan simplicial sets. Suppose now that $n$ is a positive integer; assume that both a presentable quasicategory $\operatorname{CSS}(\Delta^{\!\times n-1})$ and a fully faithful functor $c_{n-1}\colon\operatorname{CSS}(\Delta^{0})\hookrightarrow\operatorname{CSS}(% \Delta^{\!\times n-1})$ that preserves all small colimits have been constructed. Let us call a simplicial object $X\colon\mathrm{N}\Delta^{\mathrm{op}}\to\operatorname{CSS}(\Delta^{\!\times n-% 1})$ an $n$-fold Segal space if it satisfies the following pair of conditions. (B.1) The object $X_{0}$ lies in the essential image of $c_{n-1}$. (B.2) For any integers $0<k<m$, the object $X_{m}$ is exhibited as the limit of the diagram $X(\{0,1,\dots,k\})\rightarrow X(\{k\})\leftarrow X(\{k,k+1,\dots,m\}).$ Now for any $n$-fold Segal space $X$, one may apply the right adjoint to the functor $c_{n-1}$ objectwise to $X$ to obtain a simplicial space $\iota_{1}X$. Let us call $X$ an $n$-fold complete Segal space if it satisfies the following additional condition. (B.3) The Kan complex $(\iota_{1}X)_{0}$ is exhibited as the limit of the composite functor $\Delta_{/\mathrm{N}E}^{\mathrm{op}}\to\Delta^{\mathrm{op}}\stackrel{{% \scriptstyle\iota_{1}X}}{{\longrightarrow}}\operatorname{CSS}_{0},$ where the category $E$ is as in Ex. 2.2. Denote by $\operatorname{CSS}(\Delta^{\!\times n})$ the full subcategory of $\operatorname{Fun}(\mathrm{N}\Delta^{\mathrm{op}},\operatorname{CSS}(\Delta^{% \!\times n-1})$ spanned by the $n$-fold complete Segal spaces.
Definition 6.8. We shall say that a quasicategory $\mathcal{C}$ is a homotopy theory of $(\infty,n)$-categories if there is a fully faithful functor $f\colon\Upsilon_{n}\hookrightarrow\tau_{\leq 0}\mathcal{C}$ such that the following axioms are satisfied. (C.1) Strong generation. The composite $\Upsilon_{n}\hookrightarrow\tau_{\leq 0}\mathcal{C}\hookrightarrow\mathcal{C}$ strongly generates $\mathcal{C}$. In particular $\mathcal{C}$ is presentable. (C.2) Correspondences have internal homs. For any morphism $\eta\colon X\to f(C_{i})$ of $\mathcal{C}$, the fiber product functor $\eta^{*}\colon\mathcal{C}_{/f(C_{i})}\to\mathcal{C}_{/X}$ preserves colimits. Since $\mathcal{C}$ is presentable this is equivalent to the existence of internal homs for the categories of correspondences $\mathcal{C}_{/f(C_{i})}$. (hence admits a right adjoint, the internal hom). (C.3) Fundamental pushouts. Each of the finite number of maps comprising $S_{00}$ (see Not. 5.8) is an equivalence, that is: (a) For each integer $0\leq i\leq n-1$ the natural morphism $f(C_{i})\cup^{f(\partial C_{i})}f(C_{i})\to f(\partial C_{i+1})$ is an equivalence, as well as the natural map from the empty colimit to $f(\emptyset)$. (b) For each pair of integers $0\leq i<j\leq n$, the natural morphism $f(C_{j})\cup^{f(C_{i})}f(C_{j})\to f(C_{j}\cup^{C_{i}}C_{j})$ is an equivalence. (c) For each $0\leq i\leq n$, each $0<j,k\leq n-i$, and every nondegenerate morphism $C_{i+j}\to C_{i}$ and $C_{i+k}\to C_{i}$, the natural morphism $(f(C_{i+j}\cup^{C_{i}}C_{i+k}))\cup^{f(\sigma^{i+1}(C_{j-1}\times C_{k-1}))}(f% (C_{i+k}\cup^{C_{i}}C_{i+j}))\to f(C_{i+j}\times_{C_{i}}C_{i+k}),$ is an equivalence. (d) For any $0\leq k\leq n$, the natural morphism $(f(C_{k})\sqcup f(C_{k}))\cup^{(f(\sigma^{k}C_{1})\sqcup f(\sigma^{k}C_{1}))}f% (\sigma^{k}[3])\to f(C_{k})$ in $\mathcal{C}$ is an equivalence. (C.4) Universality. For any quasicategory $\mathcal{D}$ and any fully faithful functor $g\colon\Upsilon_{n}\hookrightarrow\tau_{\leq 0}\mathcal{D}$ satisfying the conditions above, there exist a localization $L\colon\mathcal{C}\to\mathcal{D}$ and an equivalence $L\circ f\simeq g$. In this situation, we say that the functor $f$ exhibits $\mathcal{C}$ as a homotopy theory of $(\infty,n)$-categories. We denote by $\operatorname{Thy}_{(\infty,n)}$ the maximal Kan simplicial set contained in the full subcategory of the quasicategory of quasicategories [28, 3.0.0.1] spanned by the homotopy theories of $(\infty,n)$-categories.
Definition 5.1. A correspondence (or $k$-correspondence, for clarity) of gaunt $n$-categories is an object of $\operatorname{Gaunt}_{n}/C_{k}$, that is a gaunt $n$-category $M$ equipped with a functor $M\to C_{k}$.
Definition 10.2 ([7, Df. 3.1]). Let $C$ be a small category. The wreath product $\Delta\wr C$ is the category • whose objects consist of tuples $([n];c_{1},\dots,c_{n})$ where $[n]\in\Delta$ and $c_{i}\in C$, and • whose morphisms from $([m];a_{1},\dots,a_{m})$ to $([n];b_{1},\dots,b_{n})$ consist of tuples $(\phi;\phi_{ij})$, where $\phi:[m]\to[n]$, and $\phi_{ij}:a_{i}\to b_{j}$ where $0<i\leq m$, and $\phi(i-1)<j\leq\phi(i)$.
Definition 6.1 ([29, 4.4.2]). A functor $f\colon\mathcal{C}\to\mathcal{D}$ between quasicategories is said to strongly generate the quasicategory $\mathcal{D}$ if the identity transformation $\operatorname{id}\colon f\to f$ exhibits the identity functor $\operatorname{id}_{\mathcal{D}}$ as a left Kan extension of $f$ along $f$.
Definition 4.2. The globular category $\mathbb{G}_{n}$ consists of the full subcategory of $\operatorname{Gaunt}_{n}$ consisting of the $i$-cells $C_{i}$ for $i\leq n$. An $n$-globular set is a presheaf of sets on $\mathbb{G}_{n}$. The $k$-cells $X_{k}$ of a globular set is the set obtained by evaluating the presheaf $X$ on $C_{k}$.
Definition 7.3. Suppose $Z\in\operatorname{\mathcal{P}}(\mathcal{R})$. For some integer $0\leq k\leq n$, we say that a morphism $Z\to C_{k}$ is degenerate if it factors through an inclusion $C_{j}\hookrightarrow C_{k}$ for $j<k$; otherwise, we say that it is nondegenerate.
Definition 1.3. Let $S$ be a set. We say that a monoidal category $\boldsymbol{M}$ is $S$-distributive if every $S$-indexed family of objects in $\boldsymbol{M\ }$has a coproduct, and the tensor product is distributive to the left and to the right over any such coproduct. More precisely, $\boldsymbol{M}$ is $S$-distributive if for any family $\left\{X_{i}\right\}_{i\in S}$ the coproduct $(\textstyle\bigoplus\nolimits_{i\in S}X_{i},\{\sigma_{i}\}_{i\in S})$ exists and, for an arbitrary object $X$, $(X\otimes(\textstyle\bigoplus\limits_{i\in S}X_{i}),\{X\otimes\sigma_{i}\}_{i% \in S})\text{\qquad and\qquad}((\textstyle\bigoplus\limits_{i\in S}X_{i})% \otimes X,\{\sigma_{i}\otimes X\}_{i\in S})$ are the coproducts of $\{X\otimes X_{i}\}_{i\in S}$ and $\{X_{i}\otimes X\}_{i\in S},$ respectively. Note that all monoidal categories are $S$-distributive, provided that $S$ is a singleton (i.e. the cardinal of $S$ is 1).
Definition 4.1. Let $\mathbf{C}$ be a topological category, we will say that $\mathbf{C}$ is an $\infty$-groupoid if $\pi_{0}\mathbf{C}$ (the associated homotopy category) is a groupoid.
Definition 4.8. The category $\mathbf{n-Type}$ is the full subcategory of $\mathbf{Top}$ consisting of spaces with the property that all homotopy groups greater than $n$ are vanishing. We say that an $\infty$-groupoid is an $n$-groupoid if it is enriched over topological spaces of type $n-1$. We denote the category of $n$-groupoids by $\mathbf{n-Grp}$.
Definition 3.1. A Kreĭn C*-category is a $*$-category ${\mathscr{C}}$ that admits at least one norm making all the normed spaces $\operatorname{Hom}_{\mathscr{C}}(A,B)$ Banach spaces, for all $A,B\in\operatorname{Ob}_{\mathscr{C}}$ and at least one covariant $*$-functor $\alpha:{\mathscr{C}}\to{\mathscr{C}}$ such that: $\displaystyle\alpha\circ\alpha=\operatorname{Id}_{\mathscr{C}},$ $\displaystyle\alpha(A)=A\ ,\quad\forall A\in\operatorname{Ob}_{\mathscr{C}},$ $\displaystyle\|\alpha(x^{*})x\|=\|x\|^{2},\quad\forall x\in\operatorname{Hom}_% {\mathscr{C}}(A,B),\ \forall A,B\in\operatorname{Ob}_{\mathscr{C}},$ $\displaystyle\forall x\in\operatorname{Hom}_{\mathscr{C}}(B,A),\ \forall A,B% \in\operatorname{Ob}_{\mathscr{C}}\ \alpha(x^{*})x\in\operatorname{Hom}_{% \mathscr{C}}(A,A)_{>}.$ Note that from the first three axioms above, for all objects $A$, the set $\operatorname{Hom}_{\mathscr{C}}(A,A)$ is always a Kreĭn C*-algebra and so it is a C*-algebra when the involution is defined as $x^{{\dagger}_{\alpha}}:=\alpha(x^{*})$ so that the last axiom above tells that $\alpha(x^{*})x$ is always a positive element in the C*-algebra $\operatorname{Hom}_{\mathscr{C}}(A,A)$ with involution ${\dagger}_{\alpha}$.
Definition 2.5. A complex C*-category is category ${\mathscr{C}}$ such that $\operatorname{Hom}_{\mathscr{C}}(A,B)$ is a complex Banach space for all $A,B\in\operatorname{Ob}_{\mathscr{C}}$ that is equipped with a contravariant involutive conjugate linear functor $*:{\mathscr{C}}\to{\mathscr{C}}$ acting identically on the objects such that $\|1_{A}\|=1$ for all $A\in\operatorname{Ob}_{\mathscr{C}}$, $\|x\circ y\|\leq\|x\|\cdot\|y\|$, for all composable $x,y\in\operatorname{Hom}_{\mathscr{C}}$, $\|x^{*}\circ x\|=\|x\|^{2}$ for all $x\in\operatorname{Hom}_{\mathscr{C}}$ and such that $x^{*}\circ x$ is a positive element in the C*-algebra $\operatorname{Hom}_{\mathscr{C}}(A,A)$ for all $x\in\operatorname{Hom}_{\mathscr{C}}(B,A)$.
Definition 2.10. A C*-envelope ${\mathscr{E}}({\mathscr{C}})$ of a C*-category ${\mathscr{C}}$ is given by a unital C*-algebra ${\mathscr{E}}({\mathscr{C}})$ and a $*$-functor $\iota:{\mathscr{C}}\to{\mathscr{E}}({\mathscr{C}})$ that satisfy the following universal factorization property: for all unital $*$-functors $\phi:{\mathscr{C}}\to{\mathscr{A}}$ into a unital C*-algebra ${\mathscr{A}}$, there exists one and only one unital $*$-homomorphism $\Phi:{\mathscr{E}}({\mathscr{C}})\to{\mathscr{A}}$ such that $\Phi\circ\iota=\phi$.
Definition 2.7. A state $\omega:{\mathscr{C}}\to{\mathbb{C}}$ on a C*-category ${\mathscr{C}}$ is map $\omega:\operatorname{Hom}_{\mathscr{C}}\to{\mathbb{C}}$ that is linear when restricted to $\operatorname{Hom}_{\mathscr{C}}(A,B)$, for all $A,B\in\operatorname{Ob}_{\mathscr{C}}$, Hermitian i.e. $\omega(x^{*})=\overline{\omega(x)}$, for all $x\in\operatorname{Hom}_{\mathscr{C}}$, normalized i.e. $\omega(1_{A})=1_{\mathbb{C}}$, for all $A\in\operatorname{Ob}_{\mathscr{C}}$, and positive i.e. $\omega(x^{*}\circ x)\geq 0$, for all $x\in\operatorname{Hom}_{\mathscr{C}}$.
Definition 2.14. A (unital) right Kreĭn C*-module ${\mathscr{M}}_{\mathscr{A}}$ over the (unital) C*-algebra ${\mathscr{A}}$ is a (unital) module over ${\mathscr{A}}$ equipped with a Hermitian sesquilinear form $(x,y)\mapsto\langle x\mid y\rangle_{\mathscr{A}}$, for all $x,y\in{\mathscr{M}}$, that admits at least one direct sum decomposition ${\mathscr{M}}={\mathscr{M}}_{+}\oplus{\mathscr{M}}_{-}$ in orthogonal ${\mathscr{A}}$-submodules such that ${\mathscr{M}}_{+}$ and $-{\mathscr{M}}_{-}$ are Hilbert C*-modules over ${\mathscr{A}}$ (again here $-{\mathscr{M}}_{-}$ denotes the module ${\mathscr{M}}_{-}$ with the restriction of the opposite of the sequilinear form on ${\mathscr{M}}$).
Definition 3.4. An involutive Hilbert C*-bimodule over the C*-algebra $\mathscr{A}$ is a Hilbert C*-bimodule ${\mathscr{M}}$ over ${\mathscr{A}}$ that is further equipped with a map $*:{\mathscr{M}}\to{\mathscr{M}}$ such that: $\displaystyle(x^{*})^{*}=x,\quad\forall x\in{\mathscr{M}},$ $\displaystyle(ax+y)^{*}=x^{*}a^{*}+y^{*},\quad\forall x,y\in{\mathscr{M}},\ % \forall a\in{\mathscr{A}},$ $\displaystyle{}_{{\mathscr{A}}}\langle x\mid y\rangle^{*}=\langle y^{*}\mid x^% {*}\rangle_{{\mathscr{A}}},\quad\forall x,y\in{\mathscr{M}}.$
Definition 2.1. A complex C*-algebra ${\mathscr{A}}$ is a complex associative algebra (i.e. a vector space over the complex numbers with a bilinear associative multiplication $\cdot:{\mathscr{A}}\times{\mathscr{A}}\to{\mathscr{A}}$) equipped with a conjugate linear map $*:{\mathscr{A}}\to{\mathscr{A}}$ such that $(x^{*})^{*}=x$, $(x\cdot y)^{*}=y^{*}\cdot x^{*}$, for all $x,y\in{\mathscr{A}}$ that is a complete metric space with a norm $\|\cdot\|:{\mathscr{A}}\to{\mathbb{R}}$ such that $\|x\cdot y\|\leq\|x\|\cdot\|y\|$ and $\|x^{*}\cdot x\|=\|x\|^{2}$, for all $x,y\in{\mathscr{A}}$. The C*-algebra is unital if there is an identity element $1_{\mathscr{A}}$ such that $x\cdot 1_{\mathscr{A}}=x=1_{\mathscr{A}}\cdot x$, for all $x\in{\mathscr{A}}$ and $\|1_{\mathscr{A}}\|=1$.
Definition 2.16. A complex Kreĭn C*-algebra is a complex $*$-algebra that admits at least one Banach norm and at least one $*$-automorphism $\alpha:{\mathscr{A}}\to{\mathscr{A}}$ such that $\alpha\circ\alpha=\operatorname{Id}_{\mathscr{A}}$ and $\|\alpha(x^{*})x\|=\|x\|^{2}$, for all $x\in{\mathscr{A}}$.
Definition 2.4. A left Hilbert C*-module ${}_{\mathscr{A}}{\mathscr{M}}$ over the C*-algebra ${\mathscr{A}}$ is a left ${\mathscr{A}}$-module equipped with an ${\mathscr{A}}$-valued inner product ${}_{\mathscr{A}}\langle\cdot\mid\cdot\rangle:(x,y)\mapsto{}_{\mathscr{A}}% \langle x\mid y\rangle$, i.e. a sesquilinear map, linear in the left variable, that is Hermitian ${}_{\mathscr{A}}\langle x\mid y\rangle^{*}={}_{\mathscr{A}}\langle y\mid x\rangle$, positive ${}_{\mathscr{A}}\langle x\mid x\rangle\in{\mathscr{A}}_{>}$, non-degenerate ${}_{\mathscr{A}}\langle x\mid x\rangle=0_{\mathscr{A}}\Leftrightarrow x=0_{% \mathscr{M}}$ in such a way that ${\mathscr{M}}$ becomes a Banach space with the norm $\|x\|_{\mathscr{M}}:=\sqrt{{}_{\mathscr{A}}\langle x\mid x\rangle}$. The Hilbert C*-module ${}_{\mathscr{A}}{\mathscr{M}}$ is unital if the C*-algebra ${\mathscr{A}}$ is unital and $1_{\mathscr{A}}\cdot x=x$, for all $x\in{\mathscr{M}}$. A right Hilbert C*-module ${\mathscr{M}}_{\mathscr{B}}$ over the C*-algebra ${\mathscr{B}}$ is defined in a similar way using a right ${\mathscr{B}}$-module, but in this case the ${\mathscr{B}}$-valued inner product $\langle x\mid y\rangle_{\mathscr{B}}$ is a sesquilinear form that is assumed to be linear in the right entry. A Hilbert C*-bimodule ${}_{\mathscr{A}}{\mathscr{M}}_{\mathscr{B}}$ over the C*-algebras ${\mathscr{A}}$ on the left and ${\mathscr{B}}$ on the right is a left Hilbert C*-module over ${\mathscr{A}}$ and also a right Hilbert C*-module over ${\mathscr{B}}$ such that $(ax)b=a(xb)$, for all $a\in{\mathscr{A}}$, $x\in{\mathscr{M}}$, $b\in{\mathscr{B}}$.3Further conditions might be imposed (such as the adjointability of the right (left) action with respect to the the left (right) inner product, imprimitivity, etc.), but we will not necessarily impose such requirements.
Definition 2.2. In a unital C*-algebra ${\mathscr{A}}$ and element $x\in{\mathscr{A}}$ is positive if it is Hermitian i.e. $x^{*}=x$ and its spectrum is positive $\operatorname{Sp}(x)\subset{\mathbb{R}}_{+}$, where the spectrum of $x\in{\mathscr{A}}$ is defined as $\operatorname{Sp}(x):=\{\mu\in{\mathbb{C}}\ |\ x-\mu\cdot 1_{\mathscr{A}}\ % \text{is not invertible}\}$. The set of positive elements of ${\mathscr{A}}$ will be denoted by ${\mathscr{A}}_{>}$.
Definition 2.6. Let ${\mathscr{C}}$ and ${\mathscr{D}}$ be two C*-categories. A covariant $*$-functor $\phi:{\mathscr{C}}\to{\mathscr{D}}$ is given by a pair of maps $\phi:A\to\phi_{A}$ between the set of objects and $\phi:x\mapsto\phi(x)$ between the set of morphisms such that $x\in\operatorname{Hom}_{\mathscr{C}}(A,B)$ implies $\phi(x)\in\operatorname{Hom}_{\mathscr{D}}(\phi_{A},\phi_{B})$, $\phi(x\circ y)=\phi(x)\circ\phi(y)$, for all composable $x,y\in\operatorname{Hom}{\mathscr{C}}$ and $\phi(x^{*})=\phi(x)^{*}$, for all $x\in\operatorname{Hom}_{\mathscr{C}}$. A covariant $*$-functor $\pi:{\mathscr{C}}\to{\mathscr{B}}(\scr{H})$ is called a representation of the C*-category ${\mathscr{C}}$.
Definition 2.3. A state over the unital C*-algebra ${\mathscr{A}}$ is a linear map $\omega:{\mathscr{A}}\to{\mathbb{C}}$ that is normalized i.e. $\omega(1_{\mathscr{A}})=1_{\mathbb{C}}$ and positive in the sense that $\omega(x)\in{\mathbb{C}}_{>}={\mathbb{R}}_{+}$ for all $x\in{\mathscr{A}}_{>}$. A unital $*$-homomorphism $\phi:{\mathscr{A}}\to{\mathscr{B}}$ between two unital C*-algebras ${\mathscr{A}},{\mathscr{B}}$ is a linear map such that $\phi(xy)=\phi(x)\phi(y)$ and $\phi(x^{*})=\phi(x)^{*}$, for all $x,y\in{\mathscr{A}}$ and $\phi(1_{\mathscr{A}})=1_{\mathscr{B}}$.
Definition 2.12. A complex Kreĭn space is a complex vector space $K$, equipped with a Hermitian sesquilinear form (linear in the second variable) $(x,y)\mapsto\langle x\mid y\rangle$, for all $x,y\in K$, that admits at least one direct sum decomposition $K=K_{+}\oplus K_{-}$ in orthogonal subspaces such that $K_{+}$ is a Hilbert space with the restriction of the sesquilinear form and $K_{-}$ is a Hilbert space with the restriction of the opposite of sesquilinear form on $K$. Any such direct sum decomposition is called a fundamental decomposition of the Kreĭn space and the linear operator $J:K\to K$ defined by $J:x_{+}+x_{-}\mapsto x_{+}-x_{-}$ is called a fundamental symmetry of the Kreĭn space.
Definition 3.6 Let $(S,P)$ be a process, with $S=I\cup O$, and let $F\subseteq[{\cal V}_{I}\rightarrow{\cal V}_{O}]$ be a set of continuous functions. We say that $(S,P)$ computes $F$ if for all $t\in{\cal T}_{S}$: $\begin{array}[]{l}t\in P\;\;\Longleftrightarrow\;\;\exists f\in F:\\ (1)\;\;\nu^{S}_{O}(t)=f(\nu^{S}_{I}(t))\\ (2)\;\;[u,v]\sqsubseteq t\;\Rightarrow\;\nu^{S}_{O}(v)\sqsubseteq f(\nu^{S}_{I% }(u)).\end{array}$
Definition 3.13 Let ${\cal M}=({\cal T},{\cal V},\mu)$ be an incremental model in which each value domain ${\cal V}_{S}$ is $\omega$-algebraic. ${\cal M}$ is causally expressive if for every sort $S$, $d\in{\cal V}_{S}$, and chain of compact elements $C=(b_{k})$ with $\bigsqcup b_{k}=d$, there exists $t\in{\cal T}_{S}$ such that: • $\mu_{S}(t)=d$ • ${<_{t}}\supseteq{<_{C}}$.
Definition 2.1 Let $S$ be a set of channel names, where for each $\alpha\in S$, there is a set $D_{\alpha}$ of atomic data which can be transmitted over $\alpha$. The domain of linear traces over $S$, ${\sf LTr}_{S}$, is the stream domain ${\sf Str}(E_{S})$, where $E_{S}=\{(\alpha,d)\mid\alpha\in S,d\in D_{\alpha}\}.$
Definition 3.2 A trace over an event structure ${\cal E}=(E,{\leqslant},{\sf Con})$ is a pair $t=(x_{t},\leqslant_{t})$, where $x_{t}\in|{\cal E}|$, and $\leqslant_{t}$ is a partial order on $x_{t}$ such that: • $\forall e\in x_{t}.\,(\{e^{\prime}\in x_{t}\mid e^{\prime}\leqslant_{t}e\}\;\;% \mbox{is finite})$ • $({\leqslant}\cap x_{t}^{2})\subseteq{\leqslant}_{t}$. Traces are partially ordered as follows: $t\sqsubseteq t^{\prime}\;\;\stackrel{{\scriptstyle\rm def}}{{% \Longleftrightarrow}}\;\;x_{t}\subseteq x_{t^{\prime}}\;\&\;{\leqslant}_{t}={% \leqslant}_{t^{\prime}}\cap x_{t}^{2}\;\&\;(e\leqslant_{t^{\prime}}e^{\prime}% \in x_{t}\;\Rightarrow\;e\in x_{t}).$
Definition 3.7 An $\omega$-algebraic cpo is incremental if whenever $b\sqsubseteq c$ in $K(D)$, there is a finite covering sequence $b=b_{0}\prec\cdots\prec b_{n}=c.$ A strict, continuous function $f:D\rightarrow E$ on incremental domains is an incremental morphism if: • $f$ weakly preserves relative covers: $[b,c]\sqsubseteq d\;\Rightarrow\;[f(b),f(c)]\sqsubseteq f(d)\;\mbox{or}\;f(b)=% f(c)\in K(d).$ • $f$ lifts relative covers: $[b^{\prime},c^{\prime}]\sqsubseteq d^{\prime}=f(d)\;\Rightarrow\;\exists b,c.(% [b,c]\sqsubseteq d\;\&\;f(b)=b^{\prime},f(c)=c^{\prime}).$
Definition 3.1 A model ${\cal M}=({\cal T},{\cal V},\mu)$ comprises: • functors ${\cal T},{\cal V}:{\bf Sort}^{\sf op}\rightarrow{{\bf Cpo}^{s}}$ • a natural transformation $\mu:{\cal T}\stackrel{{\scriptstyle.}}{{\rightarrow}}{\cal V}$ such that ${\cal V}$ preserves limits.
Definition 2.2 The domain of partially ordered traces ${\sf PTr}_{S}$ is the ideal completion of the finite partially-ordered traces with the prefix ordering, where: • A finite partially-ordered trace is an isomorphism type of finite labelled partial orders $(V,{\leqslant},\ell)$, where $\ell:V\rightarrow E_{S}$, and for each $\alpha\in S$, the subposet $\{v\in V\mid\exists d\in D_{\alpha}(\ell(v)=(\alpha,d))\}$ is linearly ordered. • The prefix ordering is defined on representatives by: $\begin{array}[]{rcl}(V,{\leqslant},\ell)\sqsubseteq(V^{\prime},{\leqslant}^{% \prime},\ell^{\prime})&\;\;\stackrel{{\scriptstyle\rm def}}{{% \Longleftrightarrow}}&V\subseteq V^{\prime}\;\&\;{\leqslant}={\leqslant}^{% \prime}\cap V^{2}\;\&\;\ell=\ell^{\prime}\restriction V\\ &&\;\&\;v\leqslant^{\prime}v^{\prime}\in V\;\Rightarrow\;v\in V.\end{array}$
Definition 3.5 A process in ${\cal M}$ is a pair $(S,P)$, where $P\subseteq{\cal T}_{S}$. Let $\{(S_{j},P_{j})\}_{j\in J}$ be a family of processes. The network composition of this family is defined by: $\parallel_{j\in J}(S_{j},P_{j})=(S,P),$ where $\begin{array}[]{rcl}S&=&\bigcup_{j\in J}S_{j}\\ P&=&\{t\in{\cal T}_{S}\mid\forall j\in J.\,(\rho^{S}_{S_{j}}(t)\in P_{j})\}.% \end{array}$
Definition 2.0.1. Let $p:X\longrightarrow S$ be a map of dendroidal sets. Then $p$ is a left fibration if the following conditions are satisfied: • $p$ is an inner fibration • For any corolla $\sigma$ of $S$ having inputs $\{s_{1},\ldots,s_{n}\}$ (note that the set of inputs could be empty) and colors $\{x_{1},\ldots,x_{n}\}$ of $X$ satisfying $p(x_{i})=s_{i}$ for $1\leq i\leq n$, there exists a corolla $\xi$ of $X$ with inputs $\{x_{1},\ldots,x_{n}\}$ such that $p(\xi)=\sigma$ • For any tree $T$ with at least two vertices and any leaf vertex $v$ of $T$, there exists a lift in any diagram of the form $\xymatrix{\Lambda^{v}[T]\ar[r]\ar[d]&X\ar[d]^{p}\\ \Omega[T]\ar[r]\ar@{-->}[ur]&S}$
Definition 4.2.1. We define the set of generating left anodynes to be the set consisting of the following maps: • For any tree $T$ with at least two vertices and any leaf vertex $v$ of $T$, the map $\Lambda^{v}[T]\longrightarrow\Omega[T]$ • For any $n\geq 0$, the map $\coprod_{i=1}^{n}\eta_{c_{i}}\longrightarrow\Omega[C_{n}]$ where $\{c_{1},\ldots,c_{n}\}$ is the set of leaves of $C_{n}$ The weakly saturated class generated by the generating left anodynes is called the class of left anodyne morphisms, although we will not have to use that class in this paper.
Definition 2.0.3. We will call a map in $\mathbf{dSets}/S$ a covariant cofibration if its underlying map of dendroidal sets is a cofibration. We will call a map $f:X\longrightarrow Y$ in $\mathbf{dSets}/S$ a covariant equivalence if for any left fibration $Z\longrightarrow S$ and normalizations $X_{(n)}$ and $Y_{(n)}$ of $X$ resp. $Y$ the induced map $\mathrm{Map}_{S}(Y_{(n)},Z)\longrightarrow\mathrm{Map}_{S}(X_{(n)},Z)$ is a weak homotopy equivalence of simplicial sets.
Definition 2.0.2. Given maps $X\longrightarrow S$ and $Y\longrightarrow S$, we define the simplicial set $\mathrm{Map}_{S}(X,Y)$ as follows: $\mathrm{Map}_{S}(X,Y)_{n}:=\mathbf{dSets}/S(X\otimes i_{!}(\Delta^{n}),Y)$ where the map $X\otimes i_{!}(\Delta^{n})\longrightarrow S$ is obtained by composing the projection map $X\otimes i_{!}(\Delta^{n})\longrightarrow X$ with the map $X\longrightarrow S$.
Definition 4.1.1. We call a dendroidal set $X$ satisfying the conditions of the previous proposition a dendroidal Kan complex.
Definition 4.3 ([7]) A positive quasitriangular structure $R(\xi,\eta)$ on $H(G;G_{+},G_{-})$ is called normal if $\xi(u)=e$ for all $u\in G_{+}$.
Definition 5.6 ([5]) A monoidal functor $(F,\varphi_{0},\varphi_{2})$ from a braided monoidal category ${\cal C}$ to a braided monoidal category ${\cal D}$ is braided if for every pair $(U,V)$ of objects in ${\cal C}$ the square $\xymatrix{&F(U)\otimes F(V)\ar[d]_{c_{F(U),F(V)}}\ar[r]^{\varphi_{2}}&F(U% \otimes V)\ar[d]^{F(c_{U,V})}\\ &F(V)\otimes F(U)\ar[r]^{\varphi_{2}}&F(V\otimes U)}$ commutes. Denote by $Br({\cal C},{\cal D})$ the category whose objects are braided monoidal functors and morphisms are natural monoidal transformations.
Definition 5.9 We say that a braided monoidal category $({\cal C},\otimes,I,a,l,r,c)$ is pseudosymmetric if it satisfies any of the two equivalent conditions from Proposition 5.8.
Definition 5.1 If $V$ is an object in a monoidal category $({\cal C},\otimes,I,a,l,r)$, an automorphism $\sigma$ of $V\otimes V$ is called a pseudosymmetric Yang-Baxter operator on $V$ if the following two dodecagons (for $\sigma$ and $\sigma^{-1}$) commute: $\xymatrix{&\ar[dl]_{\sigma\otimes id_{V}}\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;(V\otimes V)% \otimes V\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\ar[dr]^{a_{V,V,V}}&\\ (V\otimes V)\otimes V\ar[d]_{a_{V,V,V}}&&V\otimes(V\otimes V)\ar[d]^{id_{V}% \otimes\sigma}\\ V\otimes(V\otimes V)\ar[d]_{id_{V}\otimes\sigma^{\pm 1}}&&V\otimes(V\otimes V)% \ar[d]^{a_{V,V,V}^{-1}}\\ V\otimes(V\otimes V)\ar[d]_{a_{V,V,V}^{-1}}&&(V\otimes V)\otimes V\ar[d]^{% \sigma^{\pm 1}\otimes id_{V}}\\ (V\otimes V)\otimes V\ar[d]_{\sigma\otimes id_{V}}&&(V\otimes V)\otimes V\ar[d% ]^{a_{V,V,V}}\\ (V\otimes V)\otimes V\ar[dr]_{a_{V,V,V}}&&V\otimes(V\otimes V)\ar[dl]^{id_{V}% \otimes\sigma}\\ &V\otimes(V\otimes V)&}$
Definition 1.1 ([9]) Let ${\mathcal{C}}$ be a strict monoidal category and $c$ a braiding on ${\mathcal{C}}$. We say that $c$ is pseudosymmetric if the following condition holds, for all $X,Y,Z\in{\mathcal{C}}$: $\displaystyle(c_{Y,Z}\otimes id_{X})(id_{Y}\otimes c_{Z,X}^{-1})(c_{X,Y}% \otimes id_{Z})=(id_{Z}\otimes c_{X,Y})(c_{Z,X}^{-1}\otimes id_{Y})(id_{X}% \otimes c_{Y,Z}).$ In this case we say that ${\mathcal{C}}$ is a pseudosymmetric braided category.
Definition 1.3 ([9]) Let $H$ be a Hopf algebra and $R\in H\otimes H$ a quasitriangular structure. Then $R$ is called pseudotriangular if $R_{12}R^{-1}_{31}R_{23}=R_{23}R^{-1}_{31}R_{12}$.
Definition 1.8. Let ${\mathscr{C}}$ be a small category and let $D:F{\mathscr{C}}\rightarrow{\mathscr{A}}$ be a natural system with values in a complete abelian category ${\mathscr{A}}$ with exact products. We define the Baues-Wirsching cochain complex $C_{BW}^{*}({\mathscr{C}},D)$ as follows: For each integer $n\geq 0$ the $n$-th cochain object is given by $C_{BW}^{n}({\mathscr{C}},D)=\prod_{C_{0}\stackrel{{\scriptstyle f_{1}}}{{% \leftarrow}}C_{1}\stackrel{{\scriptstyle f_{2}}}{{\leftarrow}}\cdots\stackrel{% {\scriptstyle f_{n}}}{{\leftarrow}}C_{n}}D(f_{1}\circ f_{2}\circ\cdots\circ f_% {n}).$ Let $N_{\bullet}{\mathscr{C}}$ be the nerve of ${\mathscr{C}}$. Considering elements of $C_{BW}^{n}({\mathscr{C}},D)$ as maps $\sigma:N_{n}{\mathscr{C}}\rightarrow\bigcup_{f\in Mor({\mathscr{C}})}D(f)$ with $\sigma(f_{1},\ldots,f_{n})\in D(f_{1}\circ\cdots\circ f_{n})$, where $\sigma(1_{C})\in D(1_{C})$ for $n=0$, the differential $d:C_{BW}^{n}({\mathscr{C}},D)\to C_{BW}^{n+1}({\mathscr{C}},D)$ is given by $\begin{array}[]{ll}(d\sigma)(f_{1},\cdots,f_{n+1})&=(f_{1})_{*}\sigma(f_{2},% \cdots,f_{n+1})\\ &+\sum_{i=1}^{n}(-1)^{i}\sigma(f_{1},\cdots,f_{i}\circ f_{i+1},\cdots,f_{n+1})% \\ &+(-1)^{n+1}(f_{n+1})^{*}\sigma(f_{1},\cdots,f_{n}).\end{array}$ The $n$-th Baues-Wirsching cohomology is defined as $H^{n}_{BW}({\mathscr{C}},D)=H^{n}(C_{BW}^{*}({\mathscr{C}},D),d).$
Definition 2.1. Let ${\mathscr{E}}$ and ${\mathscr{B}}$ be small categories. A Grothendieck fibration is a functor $u:{\mathscr{E}}\rightarrow{\mathscr{B}}$ such that the fibers ${\mathscr{E}}_{b}=u^{-1}(b)$ depend contravariantly and pseudofunctorially on the objects $b$ of the category ${\mathscr{B}}$. The category ${\mathscr{E}}$ is also called a category fibered over ${\mathscr{B}}$.
Definition 1.11. Let ${\mathscr{A}}$ be a complete abelian category with exact products for cohomology, or a cocomplete abelian category with exact coproducts for homology. Then: (i) $M$ is called a ${\mathscr{C}}$-bimodule if $M$ is a functor of ${\mathfrak{Fun}}({\mathscr{C}}^{op}\times{\mathscr{C}},{\mathscr{A}})$. Define the cohomology $H_{HM}^{*}({\mathscr{C}},M)=H^{*}_{BW}({\mathscr{C}},\pi^{*}M)$ and dually the homology $H^{HM}_{*}({\mathscr{C}},M)=H_{*}^{BW}({\mathscr{C}},\pi^{*}M)$. (ii) $F$ is called a ${\mathscr{C}}$-module if $F$ is a functor of ${\mathfrak{Fun}}({\mathscr{C}},{\mathscr{A}})$. Define the cohomology $H^{*}({\mathscr{C}},F)=H^{*}_{BW}({\mathscr{C}},\pi^{*}p^{*}F)$ and dually the homology $H_{*}({\mathscr{C}},F)=H_{*}^{BW}({\mathscr{C}},\pi^{*}p^{*}F)$. (iii) $L$ is called a local system on ${\mathscr{C}}$ if $L$ is a functor of ${\mathfrak{Fun}}(\pi_{1}{\mathscr{C}},{\mathscr{A}})$. Define the cohomology $H^{*}({\mathscr{C}},L)=H^{*}_{BW}({\mathscr{C}},\pi^{*}p^{*}q^{*}L)$ and dually the homology $H_{*}({\mathscr{C}},L)=H_{*}^{BW}({\mathscr{C}},\pi^{*}p^{*}q^{*}L)$. (iv) $A$ is a trivial system on ${\mathscr{C}}$ if $A$ is an abelian group (resp. an object in ${\mathscr{A}}$), i. e. a functor of ${\mathfrak{Fun}}(\mathbb{1},{\mathfrak{Ab}})$ (resp. a functor of ${\mathfrak{Fun}}(\mathbb{1},{\mathscr{A}})$). Define the cohomology $H^{*}({\mathscr{C}},A)=H^{*}_{BW}({\mathscr{C}},\pi^{*}p^{*}q^{*}t^{*}A)$ and dually the homology $H_{*}({\mathscr{C}},A)=H_{*}^{BW}({\mathscr{C}},\pi^{*}p^{*}q^{*}t^{*}A)$.
Definition 1.6. Let ${\mathscr{C}}$ be a small category. The factorization category $F{\mathscr{C}}$ of ${\mathscr{C}}$ is the category whose object set is the set of morphisms of ${\mathscr{C}}$ and whose Hom-sets $F{\mathscr{C}}(f,f^{\prime})$ are the sets of pairs $(\alpha,\beta)$ such that $f^{\prime}=\beta f\alpha$, $\xymatrix{b\rto^{\beta}&b^{\prime}\\ a\uto^{f}&a^{\prime}\uto_{f^{\prime}}\lto^{\alpha}.}$ The composition of morphisms in the factorization category $F{\mathscr{C}}$ is defined by $(\alpha^{\prime},\beta^{\prime})\circ(\alpha,\beta)=(\alpha\circ\alpha^{\prime% },\beta^{\prime}\circ\beta).$
Definition 1.1. Let ${\mathscr{C}}$ be a small category and $F:{\mathscr{C}}\rightarrow{\mathscr{A}}$ a functor to an abelian category ${\mathscr{A}}$. (i) Assume ${\mathscr{A}}$ is complete and has exact products. The $n$-th cohomology of ${\mathscr{C}}$ with coefficients in $F$ is defined as: $H^{n}({\mathscr{C}},F)={\rm lim}^{n}_{{\mathscr{C}}}F.$ (ii) Assume ${\mathscr{A}}$ is cocomplete and has exact coproducts. The $n$-th homology of ${\mathscr{C}}$ with coefficients in $F$ is defined as: $H_{n}({\mathscr{C}},F)={\rm colim}_{n}^{{\mathscr{C}}}F.$
