Definition 2.8. A (complete) Heyting algebra $B$ is a (complete) Boolean algebra if it satisfies one (and hence both) of the following equivalent conditions: (1) every element of $B$ is regular; (2) every element of $B$ is complemented. A morphism of (complete) Boolean algebras is just a morphism of (complete) Heyting algebras.
Definition 2.1. A lattice $L$ is a poset $(L,\leq)$ such that every pair of elements admits a greatest lower bound (meet) denoted $\wedge$ and a least upper bound (join) denoted $\vee$. We say $L$ is bounded if it admits a minimal and a maximal element, complete if arbitrary subsets admit meets and joins, and distributive if for all $l_{1},l_{2},l_{3}\in L$ we have $l_{1}\wedge(l_{2}\vee l_{3})=(l_{1}\wedge l_{2})\vee(l_{1}\wedge l_{3}).$ A lattice $L$ is a frame if it is complete and satisfies the stronger distributivity condition that $l\wedge(\bigvee_{i\in I}m_{i})=\bigvee_{i\in I}(l\wedge m_{i})$ for all $l\in L$ and any family of elements $\{m_{i}\}$ of $L$ indexed by some set $I$.
Definition 2.6. Let $H$ be a Heyting algebra. The pseudocomplement or negation of $h\in H$ is defined to be $\neg h:=(h\Rightarrow 0).$ The element $\neg h$ is the largest element of $H$ such that $h\wedge\neg h=0$. We say $h$ is regular if $\neg\neg h=h$ and that $h$ is complemented if $h\vee\neg h=1$. We recall that regularity of $h$ is equivalent to the condition that there exists $h^{\prime}$ with $h=\neg h^{\prime}$ and that every complemented element of a Heyting algebra is regular. We denote by $H_{\neg\neg}$ the subposet of regular elements of $H$. There is an induced structure of a Heyting algebra on $H_{\neg\neg}$, but we note that $H_{\neg\neg}$ may not be a Heyting subalgebra of $H$.
Definition 5.1. Let $\mathsf{T}$ be a tensor triangulated category with small coproducts. The nilradical of $\mathsf{T}$, denoted $\sqrt{\mathsf{T}}$, is the smallest radical localizing $\otimes$-ideal containing $0$. Explicitly, it is the smallest localizing subcategory of $\mathsf{T}$ which is closed under tensoring with all objects of $\mathsf{T}$ and has the property that if it contains $Y^{\otimes n}$ then it contains $Y$.
Definition 3.1. Let $S$ be any collection of objects in an abelian category $X$. An epimorphism $\pi:\underline{M}\to M$ is an $S$-projective effacement of $M$ if given any epimorphism $f:P\to M$ with kernel in $S$, there exists $g:\underline{M}\to P$ such that $fg=\pi$. If every object $M$ in $X$ has an $S$-projective effacement, then we say that $X$ has $S$-projective effacements. Dually, an $S$-injective effacement of $M$ is an injection $\iota:M\to\overline{M}$ such that given any monomorphism $h:M\to Q$ with cokernel in $S$, there is $j:Q\to\overline{M}$ such that $jh=\iota$; we say that $X$ has $S$-injective effacements if every object in $X$ has an $S$-injective effacement.
Definition 5.6. Let $Z$ be a closed subcategory of a locally noetherian Grothendieck category $X$. We say that $Z$ is very well-closed in $X$ if any of the equivalent conditions in Theorem 5.3 holds (Van den Bergh uses this term for condition (1)).
Definition 2.2. Given a list of full subcategories $Z_{1},Z_{2},\dots,Z_{n}$ of an abelian category $X$, the Gabriel product is the full subcategory $Z=Z_{1}\cdot Z_{2}\cdot\ldots\cdot Z_{n}$ consisting of objects $M$ with filtrations $0=M_{n+1}\subseteq M_{n}\subseteq\dots\subseteq M_{1}=M$ such that $M_{i}/M_{i+1}\in Z_{i}$ for all $1\leq i\leq n$.
Definition 5.8. Let $Z$ be a closed subcategory of a locally noetherian Grothendieck category $X$, and let $S$ be a collection of objects in the category $Z$. We say that an object $M\in X$ is $S$-projective self-effacing if the identity map $M\to M$ is an $S$-projective effacement. We say that $X$ has a set of $S$-projective self-effacing generators if there is a small set of generators $\{O_{\alpha}\}$ for $X$, where each $O_{\alpha}$ is $S$-projective self-effacing.
Definition 5.2. Let $Z$ be a closed subcategory of a locally noetherian Grothendieck category $X$. We say that $Z$ is well-closed in $X$ if any of the equivalent conditions of Theorem 5.1 holds. The definition follows Van den Bergh, who uses this term for condition (3) in the theorem [VdB, Definition 3.4.6].
Definition 10. For a cardinal2We view a cardinal as the smallest ordinal of a given cardinality. ${\aleph}$ let ${{\rm CBorn}^{<{\aleph}}}\subseteq{\rm CBorn}$ be the full subcategory consisting of ${\mathcal{B}}\in{{\rm CBorn}^{<{\aleph}}}$, s.t. there is a strict epimorphism $\underset{i\in I}{\bigoplus}\,{l^{1}({\aleph}_{i})}\rightarrow{\mathcal{B}}$ with ${\aleph}_{i}<{\aleph}$ for every $i\in I$.
Definition 5. (E.g. [37] Def. 1.1.18) A functor ${\mathcal{F}}\colon{\mathcal{Q}}\rightarrow{\mathcal{Q}}^{\prime}$ between quasi-abelian categories is strictly exact, if for every strictly exact sequence ${Q}_{1}\rightarrow{Q}_{2}\rightarrow{Q}_{3}$, the sequence ${\mathcal{F}}({Q}_{1})\rightarrow{\mathcal{F}}({Q}_{2})\rightarrow{\mathcal{F}% }({Q}_{3})$ is strictly exact in ${\mathcal{Q}}^{\prime}$.
Definition 7. (E.g. [37] Def. 1.3.18) An object ${C}$ in an additive category ${\mathcal{C}}$ is projective, if ${\hom_{{\mathcal{C}}}({C},-)}$ maps strict epimorphisms to surjections in the category ${\rm Ab}$ of abelian groups. An additive category has enough projectives, if every object is a quotient of a projective one.
Definition 13. Let $({\mathcal{Q}},{\,\widehat{\otimes}\,})$ be a closed monoidal quasi-abelian category. An object ${Q}\in{\mathcal{Q}}$ is flat if the functor $-{\,\widehat{\otimes}\,}{Q}\colon{\mathcal{Q}}\rightarrow{\mathcal{Q}}$ is strictly exact.
Definition 8. Let ${\mathcal{C}}$ be an additive category. A class of projective objects $\mathcal{P}\subseteq{\mathcal{C}}$ is sufficiently large, if it is closed with respect to finite direct sums and every projective object in ${\mathcal{C}}$ is a retract of some object in $\mathcal{P}$. A generating projective class in ${\mathcal{C}}$, is a class of projectives $\mathcal{P}$, s.t. the class of all small direct sums of objects in $\mathcal{P}$ is sufficiently large.
Definition 15. Let ${{A}_{\bullet}}$ be a simplicial ${\mathcal{C}^{\infty}}$-ring. The derived category of quasi-coherent sheaves over ${{A}_{\bullet}}$ is the stabilization of ${{\rm Mod}({{{\rm Cpt}({\widetilde{{{A}_{\bullet}}}})}})}$ with respect to the suspension functor.
Definition 4. In a quasi-abelian category ${\mathcal{Q}}$ a morphism ${f}\colon{Q}_{1}\rightarrow{Q}_{2}$ is strict, if ${f}={i}\circ{p}$, where ${p}$ is a strict epimorphism and ${i}$ is a strict monomorphism (e.g. [37] Rem. 1.1.2(c)). A null sequence ${Q}_{1}\overset{{f}_{1}}{\longrightarrow}{Q}_{2}\overset{{f}_{2}}{% \longrightarrow}{Q}_{3}$ is strictly exact, if ${Q}_{1}\rightarrow{{\rm Ker}({f}_{2})}$ is a strict epimorphism (e.g. [37] Def. 1.1.9). A null sequence $\ldots\rightarrow{Q}\rightarrow{Q}^{\prime}\rightarrow\ldots$ of any length is strictly exact, if every consecutive pair of morphisms is strictly exact.
Definition 1. Let ${V}$ be an $\mathbb{R}$-vector space, possibly infinite dimensional. 1. (E.g. [19] §0.A.3) A disk in ${V}$ is a subset ${D}\subseteq{V}$, s.t. ${D}$ is convex, i.e. $tb_{0}+(1-t)b_{1}\in{D}$ for all $b_{0},b_{1}\in{D}$, $t\in[0,1]$, and ${D}$ is circled, i.e. $t{D}\subseteq{D}$ for all $t\in[-1,1]$. 2. (E.g. [19] §0.A.5) The semi-normed subspace generated by a disk ${D}\subseteq{V}$ is the linear span ${\langle{D}\rangle}:=\mathbb{R}\cdot{D}$ equipped with the gauge semi-norm ${\gamma_{{D}}}(v):=\inf\,\{r\in\mathbb{R}_{>0}\,|\,v\in r{D}\}.$ 3. (E.g. [19] §III.3.2, §I.1.1) A base of a complete convex bornology on ${V}$ is a set of disks ${\mathfrak{D}}=\{{D}_{i}\}_{i\in I}$ in ${V}$, s.t. ${V}=\underset{i\in I}{\bigcup}{D}_{i}$; ${D}^{\prime},{D}^{\prime\prime}\in{\mathfrak{D}}\Rightarrow{D}^{\prime}+{D}^{% \prime\prime}\in{\mathfrak{D}}$; ${D}\in{\mathfrak{D}}\text{ and }r\in\mathbb{R}_{>0}\Rightarrow r\cdot{D}\in{% \mathfrak{D}}$; $\forall{D}\in{\mathfrak{D}}$ the semi-normed space $({\langle{D}\rangle},{\gamma_{{D}}})$ is a Banach space. A complete convex bornology on ${V}$ is given by an equivalence class of bases, where ${\mathfrak{D}}^{\prime}\sim{\mathfrak{D}}^{\prime\prime}$, if $\forall{D}^{\prime}\in{\mathfrak{D}}^{\prime}$ $\exists{D}^{\prime\prime}\in{\mathfrak{D}}^{\prime\prime}$, s.t. ${D}^{\prime}\subseteq{D}^{\prime\prime}$, and $\forall{D}^{\prime\prime}\in{\mathfrak{D}}^{\prime\prime}\,\exists{D}^{\prime}% \in{\mathfrak{D}}^{\prime}\;{D}^{\prime\prime}\subseteq{D}^{\prime}$. A subset $S\subseteq{V}$ is bounded with respect to ${\mathfrak{D}}$, if $\exists{D}\in{\mathfrak{D}}$ such that $S\subseteq{D}$. 4. (E.g. [19] §I.1.2) A morphism between complete convex bornological spaces is a morphism of $\mathbb{R}$-vector spaces ${V}\rightarrow{V}^{\prime}$, that maps every bounded subset of ${V}$ to a bounded subset of ${V}^{\prime}$. We will denote the category of complete convex bornological spaces by ${\rm CBorn}$.
Definition 9. A commutative monoid in a symmetric monoidal category $({\mathcal{C}},{\bullet},{\mathbf{1}})$ is a triple $({\rm A},{\mu_{{\rm A}}},{\iota_{{\rm A}}})$, where ${\mu_{{\rm A}}}\colon{\rm A}{\bullet}{\rm A}\rightarrow{\rm A}$, ${\iota_{{\rm A}}}\colon{\mathbf{1}}\rightarrow{\rm A}$ satisfy the usual axioms of associativity, commutativity and unitality (e.g. [29] Def. 1.2.8). The category of such monoids will be denoted by ${\rm Comm({{\mathcal{C}}})}$.
Definition 11. Let ${\mathcal{Q}}$ be a quasi-abelian category with enough projectives, let ${\rm K{\mathcal{Q}}}$ be the category of non-positively graded complexes in ${\mathcal{Q}}$. A morphism ${f}\colon{Q^{\bullet}}\rightarrow{Q^{\prime\bullet}}$ is a weak equivalence or fibration, if for any projective ${P}\in{\mathcal{Q}}$ the morphism of complexes of abelian groups $\hom_{{\mathcal{Q}}}({P},{Q^{\bullet}})\rightarrow\hom_{{\mathcal{Q}}}({P},{Q^% {\prime\bullet}})$ is a weak equivalence or a fibration respectively.
Definition 6. ([37] Prop. 1.2.35) Let ${\mathcal{Q}}$ be a quasi-abelian category. A left abelian envelope of ${\mathcal{Q}}$ is given by an abelian category ${\mathcal{A}}$ and a functor ${\mathbb{A}}\colon{\mathcal{Q}}\rightarrow{\mathcal{A}}$, s.t. ${\mathbb{A}}$ is full and faithful; $\forall Q\in{\mathcal{Q}}$ and for any monomorphism $A\rightarrow{\mathbb{A}(Q)}$ there is $Q^{\prime}\in{\mathcal{Q}}$ $A\cong{\mathbb{A}(Q^{\prime})}$; $\forall A\in{\mathcal{A}}$ there is $Q\in{\mathcal{Q}}$ and an epimorphism ${\mathbb{A}(Q)}\rightarrow A$.
Definition 12. Let $({\mathcal{C}},{\bullet})$ be a closed symmetric monoidal finitely cocomplete category, and let ${{\rm A}_{\bullet}}\in{{\rm S}{\mathcal{C}}}$ be a simplicial commutative monoid in ${\mathcal{C}}$. An ${{\rm A}_{\bullet}}$-module ${{M}_{\bullet}}$ is almost freely generated by $\{{C}_{n}\}_{n\geq 0}\subseteq{\mathcal{C}}$, if $\forall n\geq 0$ ${M}_{n}\cong\underset{m\leq n}{\coprod}\,\underset{{\underline{n}}% \twoheadrightarrow{\underline{m}}}{\coprod}{\rm A}_{n}{\bullet}{C}_{m}$ as ${\rm A}_{n}$-modules, and for any $\sigma\colon{\underline{k}}\twoheadrightarrow{\underline{n}}$ the corresponding map ${M}_{n}\rightarrow{M}_{k}$ is given on each summand in (8) by composing ${\underline{k}}\rightarrow{\underline{n}}\rightarrow{\underline{m}}$ and mapping $\sigma^{*}{\,\widehat{\otimes}\,}{\rm Id}_{{C}_{m}}\colon{\rm A}_{n}{\bullet}{% C}_{m}\longrightarrow{\rm A}_{k}{\bullet}{C}_{m}.$
Definition 2. (E.g. [30] Def. 1.35, 1.37) Let ${\mathcal{B}}\in{\rm CBorn}$, a sequence $\{x_{k}\}_{k\in\mathbb{N}}$ in ${\mathcal{B}}$ is bornologically convergent, if there is ${D}\in{\mathfrak{D}}$ s.t. $\{x_{k}\}_{k\in\mathbb{N}}\subseteq{\langle{D}\rangle}$ and converges with respect to the gauge norm. A subset ${S}\subseteq{\mathcal{B}}$ is bornologically closed, if the limit of every convergent sequence in ${S}$ also belongs to ${S}$.
Definition 14. A simplicial ${\mathcal{C}^{\infty}}$-ring ${{A}_{\bullet}}$ is of finite presentation, if there is a surjective weak equivalence of simplicial ${\mathcal{C}^{\infty}}$-rings ${\widetilde{{{A}_{\bullet}}}}\rightarrow{{A}_{\bullet}}$, s.t. ${\widetilde{{{A}_{\bullet}}}}$ is almost free and finitely generated in each simplicial dimension.
Definition 3. (E.g. [37], Def. 1.1.3) A finitely complete and cocomplete additive category is called quasi-abelian, if pullbacks (pushouts) of strict epimorphisms (strict monomorphisms) are morphisms of the same kind.
Definition 3.3. A dit $\mathcal{D}$ is a discrete skeletal groupoid $\mathbf{D}$ with $d$ morphisms.
Definition 3.1. A groudit $\mathcal{G}$ is a skeletal groupoid of the form $\mathbf{G}=\coprod_{i}G_{i}$, where $G_{i}$ are finite groups, equipped for each $i\in\mathrm{Ob}(\mathbf{G})$ with bijections $\sigma_{i},\tau_{i}:G_{i}\xrightarrow{}\mathrm{Ob}(\mathbf{G})$.
Definition 3.2. A groubit $\mathcal{B}$ is the groudit with identity bijections, and with underlying groupoid $\mathbf{B}$ defined as follows, where $s,t$ are the source and target functions: $\displaystyle\mathrm{Ob}(\mathbf{B})$ $\displaystyle:=\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ $\displaystyle\mathrm{Mor}(\mathbf{B})$ $\displaystyle:=\mathbb{Z}_{2}\times\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ $\displaystyle s,t$ $\displaystyle:=\mathbb{Z}_{2}\times\mathbb{Z}_{2}\stackrel{{\scriptstyle\pi_{1% }}}{{\xrightarrow{}}}\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ Composition is defined as follows: $(a,b)\circ(a,c):=(a,b\oplus c).$
Definition 1.1. A functor between small categories is called a Morita equivalence if it is fully faithful and essentially surjective up to retracts.

On appelle structure de foncteur d’automorphismes sur ${\mathcal{C}}$ la donnée d’un foncteur ${\rm Aut}_{\mathcal{C}}:{\mathcal{C}}\to\mathbf{Grp}$ tel que, pour tout objet $x$ de ${\mathcal{C}}$, ${\rm Aut}_{\mathcal{C}}(x)$ soit le groupe des automorphismes de $x$ dans ${\mathcal{C}}$, et que l’axiome d’équivariance suivant soit vérifié : pour tout morphisme $f\in{\mathcal{C}}(x,y)$ de ${\mathcal{C}}$ et tout élément $u$ de ${\rm Aut}_{\mathcal{C}}(x)$, le diagramme
Definition 2.1 ([2]). The $n$th cross effect of a functor $F\colon\mathcal{A}\to\mathcal{B}$ between two abelian categories, where the zero object of $\mathcal{A}$ is denoted by $0$, is the functor $\mathrm{cr}_{n}F\colon\mathcal{A}^{n}\to\mathcal{B}$ defined recursively by $F(x)\cong F(0)\oplus\mathrm{cr}_{1}F(x)$ $\mathrm{cr}_{1}F(x_{1}\oplus x_{2})\cong\mathrm{cr}_{1}F(x_{1})\oplus\mathrm{% cr}_{1}F(x_{2})\oplus\mathrm{cr}_{2}F(x_{1},x_{2})$ and in general, $\displaystyle\mathrm{cr}_{n-1}F(x_{1}\oplus x_{2},x_{3},\ldots,x_{n})\cong$ $\displaystyle\mathrm{cr}_{n-1}F(x_{1},x_{3},\ldots,x_{n})\oplus\mathrm{cr}_{n-% 1}F(x_{2},x_{3},\ldots,x_{n})$ $\displaystyle\oplus\mathrm{cr}_{n}F(x_{1},x_{2},\ldots,x_{n}),$ where $\oplus$ denotes the biproduct in both categories $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$ (a common abuse of notation).
Definition 2.4. [1, Definition 5.1] The linearization of an abelian functor $F\colon\mathcal{A}\to\mathcal{B}$ is the (abelian) functor $D_{1}F\colon\mathcal{A}\to{Ch}\mathcal{B}$ given as the explicit chain complex $(D_{1}F_{*},\partial_{*})$ where: $(D_{1}F)_{k}\coloneqq\begin{cases}C_{2}^{\times k}F&k\geq 1\\ \mathrm{cr}_{1}F&k=0\\ 0&\text{otherwise}\end{cases}$ and $C_{2}^{\times k}$ is the functor $C_{2}=\mathrm{cr}_{2}\circ diag$ composed with itself $k$ times. The chain differential $\partial_{1}\colon(D_{1}F)_{1}\to(D_{1}F)_{0}$ is given by the map $\epsilon$ of [1, Remark 2.8], and the chain differential $\partial_{k}\colon(D_{1}F)_{k}\to(D_{1}F)_{k-1}$ is given by $\sum_{i=1}^{k}(-1)^{i}C_{2}^{\times i}\epsilon$ when $k\geq 1$, where $\epsilon$ is the counit of the adjunction of [1, Corollary 2.7].
Definition 2.7. [1, Lemma 6.3] For an abelian functor $F\colon\mathcal{A}\to\mathcal{B}$ with objects $x$ and $v$ in $\mathcal{A}$, define $\nabla F(v;x)\mathrel{:=}D_{1}F(x\oplus-)(v).$
Definition 2.3. An abelian functor $F:\mathcal{A}\rightarrow\mathcal{B}$ is degree n if $\mathrm{cr}_{n+1}F\simeq 0.$ In particular, $F$ is degree 1 if $\mathrm{cr}_{2}F\simeq 0$. If $F$ is also reduced, meaning that $F(0)\simeq 0$, then we say that $F$ is linear. We call $F$ strictly reduced if $F(0)\simeq 0$ is a chain homotopy equivalence.
Definition 2.8. [1, Definition 7.3] Consider an abelian functor $F:\mathcal{A}\rightarrow\mathcal{B}$ and objects $x$, $v$, and $w$ in $\mathcal{A}$. The higher order directional derivatives of $F$ are defined recursively by $\displaystyle\Delta_{0}F(x)$ $\displaystyle\mathrel{:=}F(x),$ $\displaystyle\Delta_{1}F(v;x)$ $\displaystyle\mathrel{:=}\nabla F(v;x),$ $\displaystyle\Delta_{2}F(w,v;x)$ $\displaystyle\mathrel{:=}\nabla(\Delta_{1}F)\left((w;v);(v;x)\right).$ We say that $\Delta_{1}F(v;x)$ is the first directional derivative of $F$ at $x$ in the direction $v$. Similarly, we say that $\Delta_{2}F(w,v;x)$ is the second higher order directional derivative of $F$ at $x$ in the directions $v$ and $w$.
Definition 3.3. Let $\omega\in H^{3}(\Lambda,\Bbbk^{\times})$. We say that $\omega$ is trivializable if it satisfies one of the equivalent conditions of Theorem 3.2. If $p:\Gamma\to\Lambda$ is an epimorphism of abelian groups such that the pullback $p^{*}\omega\in H^{3}(\Gamma,\Bbbk^{\times})$ is trivial, we say that $\omega$ is $p$-trivial.
Definition 4.4 (Morphisms between centered spaces). A function $f\colon X\to Y$ between two centered spaces $(X,\nu_{X})$ and $(Y,\nu_{Y})$ is called centered at $x\in X$ if $f(\nu_{X}(x))\preceq\nu_{Y}(f(x))$. A function which is centered at each $x\in X$ will be simply called centered.
Definition 3.1. Given $f,g\in Y^{X}$ we say $f$ is $\mathcal{P}$-related to $g$, and we write $f\hat{\mathcal{P}}g$, if the coincidence set of $f$ and $g$ belongs to $\mathcal{P}$. In other words, $f\hat{\mathcal{P}}g$ if $\{x\in X\mid f(x)=g(x)\}\in\mathcal{P}$.
Definition 2.1. Let $X$ and $\mathcal{P}$ be as above. Then: $\mathcal{P}\text{ is a }\begin{cases}\text{raster}\\ \text{filterbase}\\ \text{filter}\end{cases}\text{ on $X$ if it satisfies Conditions }\begin{cases% }\ref{defn:filter0},\ref{defn:filter1}\\ \ref{defn:filter0},\ref{defn:filter2}\\ \ref{defn:filter0},\ref{defn:filter1},\ref{defn:filter2}\end{cases}.$
Definition 3.5. Given $f,g\in Y^{X}$ we say $f$ is weakly $\mathcal{P}$-related to $g$, and we write $f\hat{\mathcal{P}}_{w}g$, if the coincidence set of $f$ and $g$ contains an element of $\mathcal{P}$. In other words, $f\hat{\mathcal{P}}_{w}g$ if there is $P\in\mathcal{P}$ such that $P\subset\{x\in X\mid f(x)=g(x)\}$.
Definition 4.1 (Centered spaces). A centered structure on a set $X$ is given by assigning to each point $x\in X$ a collection $\nu(x)$ of subsets of $X$ with the property that $x\in N$ for each $N\in\nu(x)$. A set together with a centered structure is called a centered space.
Definitions 5.1.2. [11, Def. C2.1.1, Theorem D3.3.1] A coverage $\mathcal{J}$ on a small category $\mathcal{C}$ is regular if it is generated by singleton covering families. A Grothendieck topos $\mathcal{E}$ is a regular topos if there exists a small lex category $\mathcal{C}$ and a regular coverage $\mathcal{J}$ on $\mathcal{C}$ such that $\mathcal{E}\simeq\operatorname{Sh}(\mathcal{C},\mathcal{J})$. A geometric morphism $e_{*}:\mathcal{E}_{1}\leftrightarrows\mathcal{E}_{2}:e^{*}$ between two regular toposes is regular if the inverse image functor $e^{*}$ preserves regular objects.
Definitions 3.1.2. A category $\mathcal{B}$ is regular if it is lex, it admits coequalizers of kernel pairs of all its morphisms, and in which regular epimorphisms are stable under pullbacks. A functor between $b:\mathcal{B}_{1}\to\mathcal{B}_{2}$ two regular categories is regular if it is lex and preserves regular epimorphisms. A regular category $\mathcal{B}$ is exact (in the sense of Barr) if every equivalence relation is a kernel pair of some morphism.
Definition 2.3.2. Suppose $\mathcal{K}$ is a locally finitely presentable category. An $(\omega,\lambda)$-injectivity class in $\mathcal{K}$ is a full subcategory of $\mathcal{K}$ consisting of objects injective to a set of morphisms having finitely presentable domain and $\lambda$-presentable codomain.
Definitions 4.2.1. [20, §3.4.1] A full subcategory $\mathcal{D}$ of $R\mbox{-}\operatorname{Mod}$ is definable if there is a set $\{\phi_{\lambda}(x)/\psi_{\lambda}(x)\}_{\lambda\in\Lambda}$ of pairs of pp-formulas in one variable satisfying $\phi_{\lambda}(x)\rightarrow\psi_{\lambda}(x)$ for each $\lambda$ such that $\mathcal{D}$ is precisely the subcategory of modules such that $\phi_{\lambda}(M)=\psi_{\lambda}(M)$ for each $\lambda\in\Lambda$.
Definition 2.2.1. A category is called predefinable if it has products and directed colimits and products distribute over directed colimits.
Definition 3.2.1. (cf. Definition 4.3.1) A category $\mathcal{L}$ is exactly definable if there exists a small exact category $\mathcal{B}$ such that $\mathcal{L}$ is equivalent to the category $\operatorname{Reg}(\mathcal{B},\operatorname{Set})$ of regular functors on $\mathcal{B}$.
Definitions 2.1.1. A full subcategory $\mathcal{L}$ of a locally finitely presentable category $\mathcal{K}$ is a definable subcategory if it is closed in $\mathcal{K}$ under products, directed colimits and pure subobjects. Furthermore, a category is definable if it is equivalent to a definable subcategory of a locally finitely presentable category. A functor between two definable categories is an interpretation functor if it preserves products and directed colimits.
Definitions 4.4.1. An object $A$ of an abelian category $\mathcal{A}$ with directed colimits is coherent if it is finitely presentable and each of its finitely generated subobjects is finitely presentable. An abelian category $\mathcal{G}$ with directed colimits is locally coherent if it has a generating set consisting of coherent objects. A coherent morphism $f:\mathcal{G}\to\mathcal{G}^{\prime}$ between locally coherent categories is a pair of adjoint functors $f_{*}:\mathcal{G}\leftrightarrows\mathcal{G}^{\prime}:f^{*}$ whose left adjoint maps finitely presentable objects of $\mathcal{G}^{\prime}$ to finitely presentable objects of $\mathcal{G}$.
Definition 2.3.1. We say that a full subcategory of a locally finitely presentable category is weakly definable if it is closed under products and directed colimits. Furthermore, a category is weakly definable if it is equivalent to a weakly definable subcategory of a locally finitely presentable category.
Definition 3.1.3. The free exact completion of a small lex category $\mathcal{C}$ is an exact category $\mathcal{C}_{ex/lex}$ together with a lex functor $h:\mathcal{C}\to\mathcal{C}_{ex/lex}$ such that $h$ has the following universal property: for any exact category $\mathcal{B}$, there is an equivalence of categories $-\circ h:\operatorname{Reg}(\mathcal{C}_{ex/lex},\mathcal{B})\to\operatorname{% Lex}(\mathcal{C},\mathcal{B})$.
