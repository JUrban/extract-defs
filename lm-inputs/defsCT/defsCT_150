Definition 2.44. We call $K_{0}(\operatorname{prsmalg}_{\mathsf{k}})$ with the multiplication $\bullet$ induced by $(A,B)\mapsto A\otimes^{\mathbf{L}}B.$ the Grothendieck ring of proper and smooth dg algebras.
Definition 2.2 ([TV07, Def. 2.4.5]). A dg category $\mathcal{A}$ is triangulated if the Yoneda embedding induces a quasi-equivalence $\mathcal{A}\rightarrow\operatorname{Perf}(\mathcal{A}).$ (It is enough to require that $[\mathcal{A}]\rightarrow[\operatorname{Perf}(\mathcal{A})]$ is essentially surjective.)
Definition 3.4. A Landau-Ginzburg (LG) motivic measure is a morphism of unital rings from $K_{0}({\operatorname{Var}}_{{{\mathbb{A}}}^{1}})$ to another ring.
Definition 2.23 (cf. [BLL04, Def. 5.1, 8.1]). The Grothendieck group $K_{0}(\operatorname{sat}_{\mathsf{k}})$ of saturated dg categories is defined to be the quotient of ${\mathbb{Z}}{\underline{\operatorname{sat}_{\mathsf{k}}}}$ by the subgroup generated by the elements (the ”semi-ortogonal relations”) ${\underline{\mathcal{T}}}-({\underline{\mathcal{U}}}+{\underline{\mathcal{V}}})$ whenever there is a saturated dg category $\mathcal{T}$ with full dg subcategories $\mathcal{U}$ and $\mathcal{V}$ such that $[\mathcal{T}]=\langle[\mathcal{U}],[\mathcal{V}]\rangle$ is a semi-orthogonal decomposition into admissible subcategories. (We do not require that $\mathcal{U}$ and $\mathcal{V}$ are saturated; this is automatic by Proposition 2.20.)
Definition 3.1 ([Bit04]). The (motivic) Grothendieck group $K_{0}({\operatorname{Var}}_{{{\mathbb{A}}}^{1}})$ of varieties over ${{\mathbb{A}}}^{1}$ is the free abelian group on isomorphism classes $[X]_{{{\mathbb{A}}}^{1}}$ of varieties $X\rightarrow{{\mathbb{A}}}^{1}$ over ${{\mathbb{A}}}^{1}$ subject to the relations $[X]_{{{\mathbb{A}}}^{1}}=[X-Y]_{{{\mathbb{A}}}^{1}}+[Y]_{{{\mathbb{A}}}^{1}}$ whenever $Y\subset X$ is a closed subvariety.
Definition 2.11 (cf. [TV07, Def. 2.4], [Toë09, Def. 2.3]). Let $\mathcal{A}$ be a dg category. (1) $\mathcal{A}$ is locally ($\mathsf{k}$-)perfect (or locally ($\mathsf{k}$-)proper) if $\mathcal{A}(A,A^{\prime})$ is a perfect dg $\mathsf{k}$-module (i. e. in $\operatorname{per}(\mathsf{k})$) for all $A,A^{\prime}\in\mathcal{A}.$ (2) $\mathcal{A}$ has a compact generator if the triangulated category $D(\mathcal{A})$ has a compact generator. An equivalent condition is that $\operatorname{per}(\mathcal{A})$ has a classical generator (use [BvdB03, Thm. 2.1.2]). (3) $\mathcal{A}$ is ($\mathsf{k}$-)proper if it is locally perfect and has a compact generator. (4) $\mathcal{A}$ is ($\mathsf{k}$-)smooth if $\mathcal{A}$ considered as a dg $Q(\mathcal{A})\otimes Q(\mathcal{A})^{\operatorname{op}}$-module, is in $\operatorname{per}(Q(\mathcal{A})\otimes Q(\mathcal{A})^{\operatorname{op}}).$ (5) $\mathcal{A}$ is ($\mathsf{k}$-)saturated if it is ($\mathsf{k}$-)proper, ($\mathsf{k}$-)smooth and triangulated (see Def. 2.2).
Definition 2.42. The Grothendieck group $K_{0}(\operatorname{prsmalg}_{\mathsf{k}})$ of proper and smooth dg algebras is defined to be the quotient of the abelian group ${\mathbb{Z}}{\underline{\operatorname{prsmalg}_{\mathsf{k}}}}$ by the subgroup generated by the elements (the ”lower-triangular matrix algebra relations”) ${\underline{R}}-({\underline{A}}+{\underline{B}})$ whenever $R$ is a proper and smooth dg algebra such that there are dg algebras $A$ and $B$ together with a dg $A\otimes B^{\operatorname{op}}$-module $N=\leftidx{{}_{B}}{N}{{}_{A}}$ such that $R={\left(\begin{smallmatrix}{A}&{0}\\ {N}&{B}\end{smallmatrix}\right)}.$ (We do not require that $A$ and $B$ are smooth and proper since this is automatic: properness of $A$ and $B$ is obvious, and smoothness follows from [LS13b, Thm. 3.24 and Rem. 3.25].)
Definition 1.6. Let $X$ be an $(\mathbf{m},\mathbf{s})$-type matrix over $A$, $\mathbf{m},\mathbf{s}\in{\mathbb{N}}^{I}$. (a) An $(\mathbf{s},\mathbf{t})$-type matrix $Y$ over $A$ is called a right universal annihilator of $X$ if it satisfies the following two conditions: (1) $XY=0$, (2) if $M$ is an $(\mathbf{s},\mathbf{l})$-type matrix over $A$ with $XM=0$, then there is a unique $(\mathbf{t},\mathbf{l})$-type matrix $Z$ over $A$ such that $M=YZ$. (b) An $(\mathbf{t},\mathbf{m})$-type matrix $Y$ over $A$ is called a left universal annihilator of $X$ if it satisfies the following two conditions: (1) $YX=0$, (2) if $M$ is an $(\mathbf{l},\mathbf{m})$-type matrix over $A$ with $MX=0$, then there is a unique $(\mathbf{l},\mathbf{t})$-type matrix $Z$ over $A$ such that $M=ZY$.
Definition 1.3. Let $r\geqslant 1$ be an integer and $X=\left(\begin{array}[]{cccc}x_{11}&x_{12}&\cdots&x_{1s}\\ x_{21}&x_{22}&\cdots&x_{2s}\\ \cdots&\cdots&\cdots&\cdots\\ x_{m1}&x_{m2}&\cdots&x_{ms}\\ \end{array}\right)$ be an $m\times s$-matrix over $A^{\otimes_{\mathbb{F}}r}:=A\otimes_{\mathbb{F}}A\otimes_{\mathbb{F}}\cdots% \otimes_{\mathbb{F}}A$, the tensor product algebra of $r$-folds of $A$ over ${\mathbb{F}}$. If there exist $1\leqslant i_{11},i_{12},\cdots,i_{1m},i_{21},i_{22},\cdots,i_{2m},\cdots,i_{r% 1},i_{r2},\cdots,$ $i_{rm}\leqslant n$ and $1\leqslant j_{11},i_{12},\cdots,i_{1s},j_{21},j_{22},\cdots,j_{2s},\cdots,j_{r% 1},j_{r2},\cdots,j_{rs}\leqslant n$ such that $\begin{array}[]{rl}x_{lt}\in&(e_{i_{1l}}\otimes_{\mathbb{F}}e_{i_{2l}}\otimes_% {\mathbb{F}}\cdots\otimes_{\mathbb{F}}e_{i_{rl}})A^{\otimes_{\mathbb{F}}r}(e_{% j_{1t}}\otimes_{\mathbb{F}}e_{j_{2t}}\otimes_{\mathbb{F}}\cdots\otimes_{% \mathbb{F}}e_{j_{rt}})\\ &=(e_{i_{1l}}Ae_{j_{1t}})\otimes_{\mathbb{F}}(e_{i_{2l}}Ae_{j_{2t}})\otimes_{% \mathbb{F}}\cdots\otimes_{\mathbb{F}}(e_{i_{rl}}Ae_{j_{rt}})\\ \end{array}$ for all $1\leqslant l\leqslant m$ and $1\leqslant t\leqslant s$, then $X$ is called a homogeneous matrix over $A^{\otimes_{\mathbb{F}}r}$.
Definition 2.1. Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a tensor category. The Green ring $r(\mathcal{C})$ of $\mathcal{C}$ is the abelian group generated by the isomorphism classes $[V]$ of objects $V$ of $\mathcal{C}$ modulo the relations $[M\oplus V]=[M]+[V]$. The multiplication of $r(\mathcal{C})$ is given by the tensor product of objects, that is, $[M][V]=[M\otimes V]$, where $M$ and $V$ are objects of $\mathcal{C}$.
Definition 1.1. (1) Let $R$ be a ring free as a module over $\mathbb{Z}$. A $\mathbb{Z}_{+}$-basis of $R$ is a $\mathbb{Z}$-basis $B=\{b_{i}\}_{i\in I}$ such that for any $i,j\in I$, $b_{i}b_{j}=\sum_{l}c_{ijl}b_{l}$ with $c_{ijl}\in{\mathbb{N}}$. (2) A $\mathbb{Z}_{+}$-ring is a $\mathbb{Z}$-algebra with unity endowed with a fixed $\mathbb{Z}_{+}$-basis. (3) A $\mathbb{Z}_{+}$-ring with a $\mathbb{Z}_{+}$-basis $B$ is a unital $\mathbb{Z}_{+}$-ring if $1\in B$.
Definition 3.15. Two families $\{a_{i,j,l}\}_{i,j,l\in I}$ and $\{a^{\prime}_{i,j,l}\}_{i,j,l\in I}$ of matrices are called equivalent if there exists a family of invertible matrices $\eta(i,j)$ in $M_{\mathbf{c}_{ij}}(A)$ indexed by all couples $(i,j)$ of elements of $I$ such that $(x\widehat{\otimes}y)\eta(i,j)=\eta(i^{\prime},j^{\prime})(x\widehat{\otimes}y)$ and $\begin{array}[]{rl}&\sum\limits_{t=1}^{n}\sum\limits_{1\leqslant k\leqslant c_% {ijt}}a_{i,j,l}(X^{\mathbf{c}_{ij}}_{t,k}\widehat{\otimes}e_{l})\eta(t,l)(Y^{% \mathbf{c}_{ij}}_{t,k}\eta(i,j)\widehat{\otimes}e_{l})\\ =&\sum\limits_{t=1}^{n}\sum\limits_{1\leqslant k\leqslant c_{jlt}}(e_{i}% \widehat{\otimes}X^{\mathbf{c}_{jl}}_{t,k})\eta(i,t)(e_{i}\widehat{\otimes}Y^{% \mathbf{c}_{jl}}_{t,k}\eta(j,l))a^{\prime}_{i,j,l}\\ \end{array}$ for all $i,j,l,i^{\prime},j^{\prime}\in I$, $x\in e_{i^{\prime}}Ae_{i}$ and $y\in e_{j^{\prime}}Ae_{j}$.
Definition 1.5. An $(\mathbf{m},\mathbf{s})$-type matrix $X$ over $A$ is called column-independent if for any $(\mathbf{s},\mathbf{l})$-type matrix $Y$ over $A$, $XY=0$ implies $Y=0$. $X$ is called row-independent if for any $(\mathbf{l},\mathbf{m})$-type matrix $Y$ over $A$, $YX=0$ implies $Y=0$.
Definition \thedfnCt. Let $\mathbf{C}$ be a category, and let $X$ be an object in $\mathbf{C}$. Then $X$ is said to be projective if for every epimorphism $\pi\colon Y\to Z$ and every morphism $\varphi\colon X\to Z$ there exists a morphism $\tilde{\varphi}\colon X\to Y$ such that $\pi\circ\tilde{\varphi}=\varphi$. The morphism $\tilde{\varphi}$ is called a lift of $\varphi$. Dually, $X$ is said to be injective if for every monomorphism $\iota\colon Z\to Y$ and every morphisms $\varphi\colon Z\to X$ there exists a morphism $\tilde{\varphi}\colon Y\to X$ such that $\tilde{\varphi}\circ\iota=\varphi$. The morphism $\tilde{\varphi}$ is called an extension of $\varphi$. Thus, $X$ is projective (injective), if in the left (right) diagram below, for given solid arrows, the dashed arrow exists making the diagram commutative: $\xymatrix{&Y\ar@{->>}[d]^{\pi}&&&Y\ar@{..>}[dl]_{\tilde{\varphi}}\\ X\ar[r]_{\varphi}\ar@{..>}[ur]^{\tilde{\varphi}}&Z&&X&Z\ar[l]^{\varphi}\ar@{{}% ^{(}->}[u]_{\iota}.}$
Definition \thedfnCt. Let $\mathbf{C}$ be a category, and let $X$ be an object in $\mathbf{C}$. Then $X$ is said to be semiprojective if for every inductive system $(I,Y_{i},\pi_{i,j})$ in $\mathbf{C}$ with connecting epimorphisms and for which the direct limit $\varinjlim Y_{i}$ exists, and for every morphism $\varphi\colon X\to\varinjlim Y_{i}$, there exist $i\in I$ and a morphism $\tilde{\varphi}\colon X\to Y_{i}$ such that $\pi_{i,\infty}\circ\tilde{\varphi}=\varphi$. The morphism $\tilde{\varphi}$ is called a partial lift of $\varphi$. Dually, $X$ is said to be semiinjective if for every inverse system $(I,Y_{i},\iota_{i,j})$ in $\mathbf{C}$ with connecting monomorphisms and for which the inverse limit $\varprojlim Y_{i}$ exists, and for every morphisms $\varphi\colon\varprojlim Y_{i}\to X$, there exist $i\in I$ and a morphism $\tilde{\varphi}\colon Y_{i}\to X$ such that $\tilde{\varphi}\circ\iota_{\infty,i}=\varphi$. The morphism $\tilde{\varphi}$ is called an partial extension of $\varphi$.
Definition \thedfnCt. A direct system (an inverse system) in a category $\mathbf{C}$ is an upward directed (downward directed) set $I$, together with objects $X_{i}$ for $i\in I$ and morphisms $\pi_{i,j}\colon X_{i}\to X_{j}$ for $i,j\in I$ with $i\leq j$, satisfying $\pi_{i,i}={\mathrm{id}}_{X_{i}}$ for every $i\in I$ and satisfying $\pi_{i,k}=\pi_{j,k}\circ\pi_{i,j}$ for all $i,j,k\in I$ with $i\leq j\leq k$. The morphisms $\pi_{i,j}$ are called the connecting morphisms of the system. Given a direct system $(I,X_{i},\pi_{i,j})$, a direct limit (also called inductive limit) is an object $X$ together with a family $\pi=(\pi_{i,\infty})_{i\in I}$ of morphisms $\pi_{i,\infty}\colon X_{i}\to X$ satisfying $\pi_{j,\infty}\circ\pi_{i,j}=\pi_{i,\infty}$ for all $i,j\in I$ with $i\leq j$, and such that $(X,\pi)$ is universal with these properties. Dually, given an an inverse system $(I,X_{i},\pi_{i,j})$, an inverse limit is an object $X$ together with a family $\pi=(\pi_{\infty,i})_{i\in I}$ of morphisms $\pi_{\infty,i}\colon X\to X_{i}$ satisfying $\pi_{i,j}\circ\pi_{\infty,i}=\pi_{\infty,j}$ for all $i,j\in I$ with $i\leq j$, and such that $(X,\pi)$ is universal with these properties.
Definition \thedfnCt. Let $X$ be a metric space. Then: (1) $X$ is called an absolute retract if whenever $X$ is embedded as a closed subset of another metric space $Y$, there exists a retract $Y\to X$. (2) $X$ is called an absolute neighborhood retract if whenever $X$ is embedded as a closed subset of another metric space $Y$, there exist a neighborhood $U$ of $X$ in $Y$ and a retract $U\to X$.
Definition 3.2. Suppose that $f:X\rightarrow Y$ is a map of presheaves of categories. Then we say that $f$ is a local equivalence of presheaves of categories if and only if 1. The sheafification of the diagram $\xymatrix{\mathrm{Mor}(X)\ar[r]\ar[d]&\ar[d]\mathrm{Mor}(Y)\\ \mathrm{Ob}(X)\times\mathrm{Ob}(X)\ar[r]&\mathrm{Ob}(Y)\times\mathrm{Ob}(Y)}$ is a pullback. 2. $\phi_{f}:\mathrm{Iso}(Y)^{[\textbf{1}]}\times_{Y}X\rightarrow Y$ has the local right lifting property with respect to $\emptyset\rightarrow*$.
Definition 4.1. We call a map $f:X\rightarrow Y$ of presheaves of simplicial categories a local trivial sCat-fibration if and only if it has the local right lifting property with respect to all maps 1. $\emptyset\rightarrow*$. 2. $\mathcal{U}(\partial\Delta^{n})\rightarrow\mathcal{U}(\Delta^{n}),n\in\mathbb{N}$.
Definition 6.1. Suppose that we have model category $M$. For $X,Y\in\mathrm{Ob}(M)$ there is a category $h(X,Y)_{M}$ in which the objects are cocycles, i.e. diagrams $X\xleftarrow{f}A\xrightarrow{g}Y,$ where $f$ a weak equivalence. One writes $(f,g)$ for the cocycle depicted above. The morphisms in $h(X,Y)_{M}$ are commutative diagrams $\xymatrix{&A\ar[dl]_{f}\ar[dd]\ar[dr]^{g}&\\ X&&Y\\ &A^{\prime}\ar[ul]^{f^{\prime}}\ar[ur]_{g^{\prime}}&}$
Definition 2.1. There is a functor $\mathcal{U}:\mathrm{sSet}\rightarrow\mathrm{sCat}$ such that $\mathcal{U}(S)$ is a simplicial category which has two objects x, y, $\mathrm{hom}_{\mathcal{U}(S)}(x,y)=S$ and $\mathcal{U}(S)$ has no other non-identity morphisms.
Definition 6.8. We write $G:\mathrm{Cat}\rightarrow\mathrm{Gpd}$ for the groupoid completion functor. We write $G:\mathrm{sCat}\rightarrow\mathrm{sGpd}$ for the functor defined by $G(C)_{n}=G(C_{n})$.
Definition 3.3. We call a map $f:X\rightarrow Y$ of presheaves of simplicial categories a local sCat-equivalence if and only if 1. The following diagram is homotopy cartesian for the injective model structure $\xymatrix{\mathrm{Mor}(X)\ar[r]\ar[d]&\mathrm{Mor}(Y)\ar[d]_{(s,t)}\\ \mathrm{Ob}(X)\times\mathrm{Ob}(X)\ar[r]&\mathrm{Ob}(Y)\times\mathrm{Ob}(Y)}$ 2. $\pi_{0}(X)\rightarrow\pi_{0}(Y)$ is a local equivalence of presheaves of categories.
Definition 2.3. Suppose that $\Omega^{*}$ is a cosimplicial object of a category $C$. Then there is a pair of adjoint functors associated to $\Omega^{*}$ $|\,\,|_{\Omega^{*}}:sSet\leftrightarrows C:Sing_{\Omega^{*}}.$ The left adjoint is given by $|S|_{\Omega^{*}}=\underset{\Delta^{n}\rightarrow S}{\underset{\longrightarrow}% {lim}}\Omega^{n}$ and the right adjoint is given by $Sing_{\Omega^{*}}(S)_{n}=hom(\Omega^{n},S)$. The right adjoint is known as a singular functor associated to $\Omega^{*}$.
Definition 3.4. We say that a square as in (4) is collection if the following holds in the internal logic2Since the statement involves quantifying over a class of objects we need to use stack semantics to phrase it in the internal language. See e.g. the description by Roberts in [23, Section 2] for details.. For all $a\in A$ and for each cover $e\colon E\twoheadrightarrow B_{a}$ there is $c\in C_{a}$ and a map $t\colon D_{c}\rightarrow E$ such that $q_{a,c}=e\circ t$.
Definition 6.1. Let $f$ be a map in $\mathbb{C}/I$ and let $g$ be a map in $\mathbb{C}/J$. A family of lifting problems from $f$ to $g$ over $K\in\mathbb{C}$ is diagram of the following form, where the squares on the left are both pullbacks. $\begin{gathered}\displaystyle\xymatrix{U\ar[d]&\displaystyle\sigma^{\ast}(U)% \ar[l]\ar[r]\ar[d]\save*!/dl-1.2pc/dl:(-1,1)@^{|-}\restore&\displaystyle X\ar[% d]\\ \displaystyle V\ar[d]&\displaystyle\sigma^{\ast}(V)\ar[l]\ar[r]\ar[d]\save*!/% dl-1.2pc/dl:(-1,1)@^{|-}\restore&\displaystyle Y\ar[d]\\ \displaystyle I&\displaystyle K\ar[l]_{\sigma}\ar[r]&\displaystyle J\end{gathered}}$ A solution to the family of lifting problems is a map $\sigma^{\ast}(V)\rightarrow X$ making the upper right square into two commutative triangles.
Definition 2.2. Suppose we are given maps $f,g,h$ and $r$ as in the following diagram. $\begin{gathered}\displaystyle\xymatrix{R\ar[r]^{k}&\displaystyle X\ar[r]^{f}% \ar[dl]_{h}&\displaystyle Y\ar[dr]^{g}\\ \displaystyle Z&&&\displaystyle Z\end{gathered}}$ We say the diagram is coherent, or satisfies the coherence condition if $g\circ f\circ k=h\circ k$. We say that a diagram as in (1) satisfying the coherence condition is a polynomial with reductions. We refer to the subdiagram consisting of $f$, $g$ and $h$ as the underlying polynomial, and to $R$ and $k$ as the reductions.
Definition 6.15. Let $f\colon X\rightarrow Y$ be a morphism in $\mathbb{C}/J$ for some $J\in\mathbb{C}$. We say a family of lifting problems from (9) to $f$ is a family of lifting problems (in the sense of definition 6.1) from $m_{1}$ to $f$.
Definition 4.4. We say a polynomial with reductions is decidable if it satisfies one of the equivalent conditions in proposition 4.3.
Definition 6.17. The universal family of lifting problems from (9) to $f\colon X\rightarrow Y$ is the universal family of lifting problems from $m_{1}$ to $f$.
Definition 3.9. Let $u\colon U\rightarrow I$ be a morphism in $\mathbb{C}$. A $2$-cover base for $u$ consists of two squares of the following form that are both covering and collection. $\begin{gathered}\displaystyle\xymatrix{A\ar[r]^{q}\ar[d]_{g}&\displaystyle X% \ar[d]^{f}\\ \displaystyle J\ar[r]_{p}&\displaystyle Y\end{gathered}}$ $\begin{gathered}\displaystyle\xymatrix{B\ar[r]^{t}\ar[d]_{h}&\displaystyle A% \times_{X}A\ar[d]^{\langle g,g\rangle}\\ \displaystyle K\ar[r]_{s}&\displaystyle J\times_{Y}J\end{gathered}}$
Definition 6.3. Fix a map $Y\rightarrow J$. Step 1 of the small object argument at $Y$ is the pointed endofunctor $R_{1}\colon\mathbb{C}/Y\rightarrow\mathbb{C}/Y$ defined as follows. Suppose that we are given $f\colon X\rightarrow Y$ in $\mathbb{C}/Y$. We first form the universal lifting problem from $m$ to $f$ as in definition 6.2. We then define $R_{1}f$ to be the unique map out of the pushout, with unit given by the pushout inclusion $\lambda_{f}$, as below. $\xymatrix{\sigma^{\ast}(U)\ar[rr]\ar[d]&&X\ar[dd]\ar[dl]|{\lambda_{f}}\\ \sigma^{\ast}(V)\ar[r]\ar@/_{/}[drr]&K_{1}f\save*!/dr+1.2pc/dr:(1,-1)@^{|-}% \restore\ar[dr]|{R_{1}f}&\\ &&Y}$
Definition 3.1. Let $\mathbb{C}$ be a category. A map $f\colon B\rightarrow A$ is a cover if the only subobject of $A$ that it factors through is $A$ itself.
Definition 4.6. We say a polynomial with reductions in presheaves is locally decidable if its image in $\mathbb{C}/\mathcal{C}_{0}$ after forgetting the action is decidable.
Definition 2.1 (Gambino and Hyland). A polynomial is a diagram of the following form. $\begin{gathered}\displaystyle\xymatrix{&\displaystyle X\ar[r]^{f}\ar[dl]_{h}&% \displaystyle Y\ar[dr]^{g}\\ \displaystyle Z&&&\displaystyle Z\end{gathered}}$ A dependent polynomial endofunctor is an endofunctor $\mathbb{C}/Z\rightarrow\mathbb{C}/Z$ of the form $\Sigma_{g}\Pi_{f}h^{\ast}$, where $g$, $f$ and $h$ are as above. We denote this endofunctor as $P_{f,g,h}$. A dependent $W$-type is an initial object in the category of $P_{f,g,h}$-algebras for some dependent polynomial endofunctor $P_{f,g,h}$.
Definition 6.2. Let $f$ be a map in $\mathbb{C}/I$ and let $g$ be a map in $\mathbb{C}/J$. The universal family of lifting problems from $f$ to $g$, is the family of lifting problems, where we define $K$ to be type below, $\Sigma_{i:I}\Sigma_{j:J}\Sigma_{\beta:V(i)\rightarrow Y(j)}\Pi_{v:V(i)}(U(i,v)% \rightarrow X(j,\beta(v)))$ and the right maps in the family of lifting problems are given by evaluation.
Definition 3.5. Let $\mathbb{C}$ be a regular category. We say that a map $f\colon B\rightarrow A$ admits a cover base if $f$ fits into the right hand side of a square as in (4) that is both covering and collection. The axiom weakly initial set of covers ($\mathbf{WISC}$) states that any map admits a cover base.
Definition 6.16. A solution to the family of lifting problems is a map $\sigma^{\ast}(V_{0})\rightarrow X$ making the upper rectangle in (10) into two commutative triangles.
Definition 8.3. We say a map in $\mathcal{KV}$ is a computable Hurewicz fibration if it has the fibred right lifting property against the following (trivial) family of maps. $\xymatrix{1\ar[rr]^{\delta_{0}}\ar[dr]&&[0,1]\ar[dl]\\ &1&}$
Definition 4.5. When we are working in the internal logic of the locally cartesian closed category, and $y\in Y_{z}$, we will say $y$ does not reduce if $R_{z,y,x}$ is empty for all $x$, and we will say $y$ reduces at $x$ if $x$ is unique such that $R_{z,y,x}$ is inhabited.
Definition 6.18. Fix a square over an object $I$ as in (9). We define a pointed endofunctor $R_{1}$ over $\operatorname{cod}$ called step one of the small object argument as follows. Given $f\colon X\rightarrow Y$ we define $R_{1}f$ to be the map below given by the universal property of the pushout, where we take $\sigma\colon K\rightarrow I$ to be as in the universal lifting problem from the square to $f$. The unit at $f$, is given by the inclusion $\lambda_{f}$ into the pushout. $\xymatrix{\sigma^{\ast}(U_{0})\ar[d]\ar[r]&\sigma^{\ast}(U_{1})\ar[rr]&&X\ar[% dd]\ar[dl]|{\lambda_{f}}\\ \sigma^{\ast}(V_{0})\ar[rr]\ar@/_{/}[drrr]&\ar[r]&K_{1}f\save*!/dr+1.2pc/dr:(1% ,-1)@^{|-}\restore\ar[dr]|{R_{1}f}&\\ &&&Y}$
Definition 2.4. Suppose we are given a polynomial with reductions as in definition 2.2. We construct a pointed endofunctor $P_{f,g,h,k}$ as follows. Note that the coherence conditions gives us the isomorphism (equality, in fact) $\Sigma_{g}\Sigma_{f}\Sigma_{k}\cong\Sigma_{h}\Sigma_{k}$. We construct a map $\Sigma_{h}\Sigma_{k}k^{\ast}f^{\ast}\Pi_{f}h^{\ast}\rightarrow\operatorname{Id% }_{\mathbb{C}/Z}$ as follows. Note that we have an evaluation map $f^{\ast}\Pi_{f}\rightarrow\operatorname{Id}_{\mathbb{C}/Z}$ in $\mathbb{C}/X$ (which is just the counit of the adjunction $f^{\ast}\dashv\Pi_{f}$). We also have a map $\Sigma_{k}k^{\ast}\rightarrow\operatorname{Id}_{\mathbb{C}/Z}$ over $X$ given by the counit of the adjunction $\Sigma_{k}\dashv k^{\ast}$ (which recall is just one of the projection maps in the pullback). We have a similar such map for $h$. We put these together in the following composition: $\Sigma_{h}\Sigma_{k}k^{\ast}f^{\ast}\Pi_{f}h^{\ast}\longrightarrow\Sigma_{h}% \Sigma_{k}k^{\ast}h^{\ast}\longrightarrow\Sigma_{h}h^{\ast}\longrightarrow% \operatorname{Id}_{\mathbb{C}/Z}$ Again using the counits of $\Sigma$ and pullback adjunctions we get a composition $\Sigma_{g}\Sigma_{f}\Sigma_{k}k^{\ast}f^{\ast}\Pi_{f}h^{\ast}\longrightarrow% \Sigma_{g}\Sigma_{f}f^{\ast}\Pi_{f}h^{\ast}\longrightarrow\Sigma_{g}\Pi_{f}h^{\ast}$ Finally, we combine these together to get two maps out of $\Sigma_{h}\Sigma_{k}k^{\ast}f^{\ast}\Pi_{f}h^{\ast}$ in $\mathbb{C}/Z$ and then take the pushout. $\begin{gathered}\displaystyle\xymatrix{\Sigma_{h}\Sigma_{k}k^{\ast}f^{\ast}\Pi% _{f}h^{\ast}\ar[r]\ar[d]&\displaystyle\operatorname{Id}_{\mathbb{C}/Z}\ar[d]\\ \displaystyle\Sigma_{g}\Pi_{f}h^{\ast}\ar[r]&\displaystyle P_{f,g,h,k}\save*!/% dr+1.2pc/dr:(1,-1)@^{|-}\restore\end{gathered}}$ This defines a pointed endofunctor on $\mathbb{C}/Z$ with the point given by the right hand inclusion of the pushout. We will refer to pointed endofunctors defined in this way as pointed polynomial endofunctors.
Definition 6.5. We say $R_{1}$ is strongly fibred if it is preserved by pullback along all maps $Y^{\prime}\rightarrow Y$.
Definition 3.3. Suppose we are given a square of the form below. $\begin{gathered}\displaystyle\xymatrix{D\ar[r]^{q}\ar[d]_{g}&\displaystyle B% \ar[d]^{f}\\ \displaystyle C\ar[r]_{p}&\displaystyle A\end{gathered}}$ We say the square is covering if both $p$ and the canonical map $D\rightarrow B\times_{A}C$ are covers.
Definition 2.6. Let $f,g,h,k$ be a polynomial with reductions. We refer to the initial object of the category of $P_{f,g,h,k}$-algebras (if it exists) as the $W$-type with reductions on $f,g,h,k$.
Definition 6.9. Let $R$ be a ${\mathbb{Z}}_{+}$-ring. (1) A left (resp. right) ideal $I$ of $R$ will be called a a left (resp. right) Serre ideal if it has the properties that $I=(I\cap R_{+})-(I\cap R_{+})\quad\mbox{and}\quad s\in R_{+},r\in I\cap R_{+},% s\leq r\Rightarrow s\in I.$ (2) A Serre ideal of $R$ is a 2-sided ideal $I$ of $R$ which satisfies (6.3). (3) A Serre prime ideal of $R$ is a proper Serre ideal $P$ of $R$ that has the property that $IJ\subseteq P\quad\Rightarrow\quad I\subseteq P\;\;\mbox{or}\;\;J\subseteq P$ for all Serre ideals $I,J$ of $R$. (4) A Serre semiprime ideal of $R$ is an ideal which is the intersection of Serre prime ideals. (5) A Serre completely prime ideal of $R$ is a proper Serre ideal $P$ that has the property that for all $r,s\in R_{+}$, $rs\in P\quad\Rightarrow\quad r\in P\quad\mbox{or}\quad s\in P.$
Definition 4.1. (1) An abelian 2-category will be called left (resp. right) noetherian if it satisfies the ascending chain condition on thick left (resp. right) ideals. (2) An abelian 2-category will be called noetherian if it is both left and right noetherian. (3) An abelian 2-category will be called weakly noetherian if it satisfies the ascending chain condition on (two-sided) thick ideals.
Definition 7.5. The primitive spectrum of an abelian 2-category $\mathcal{T}$, denoted $\operatorname{Prim}(\mathcal{T})$, is the subset of $\mathrm{Serre}\mbox{-}\mathrm{Spec}(\mathcal{T})$ consisting of all primes $\mathcal{P}$ for which there exists a simple exact 2-representation $\mathcal{F}$ of $\mathcal{T}$ with $\mathcal{P}=\operatorname{Ann}(\mathcal{F})$.
Definition 5.6. A thick ideal of an abelian 2-category will be called semiprime if it is an intersection of prime ideals.
Definition 2.2. We will say that a 2-category $\mathcal{T}$ is an abelian 2-category if $\mathcal{T}(A_{1},A_{2})$ are abelian categories for all $A_{1},A_{2}\in\mathcal{T}$ and the compositions $\mathcal{T}(A_{2},A_{3})\times\mathcal{T}(A_{1},A_{2})\to\mathcal{T}(A_{1},A_{% 3})$ are exact bifunctors for all $A_{1},A_{2},A_{3}\in\mathcal{T}$. More generally, for a ring $\Bbbk$, we will say that $\mathcal{T}$ is a $\Bbbk$-linear abelian 2-category if $\mathcal{T}(A_{1},A_{2})$ are $\Bbbk$-linear abelian categories for $A_{1},A_{2}\in\mathcal{T}$.
