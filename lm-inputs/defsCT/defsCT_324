Definition 2.1. We define a simplicial complex to be a pair $X=(V,\Sigma)$ where $V$ is a set of vertices and $\Sigma\subseteq{\mathcal{P}}(V)$ is a collection of finite subsets of $V$ with the property that $\{v\}\in\Sigma$ for every $v\in V$ and if $\tau\in\Sigma$, then any subset $\sigma\subseteq\tau$ also belongs to $\Sigma$. An element $\sigma\in\Sigma$ is called a simplex of rank $|\sigma|-1$. The boundary $\partial\tau$ of a simplex $\tau$ consists of all simplices of rank $|\tau|-2$ contained in $\tau$.
Definition 3.2. A type $A:\mathsf{Type}$ is codiscrete if $(\mathord{\hskip 1.0pt\text{--}\hskip 1.0pt})^{\sharp}:A\to\sharp A$ is an equivalence.
Definition 10.1. The topological circle $\mathbb{S}^{1}$ is the (homotopy) coequalizer of the pair of maps $\xymatrix{\mathbb{R}\ar@<1mm>[r]^{\mathsf{id}}\ar@<-1mm>[r]_{+1}&\mathbb{R}}.$
Definition 8.1. A type $A$ is concrete if $(\mathord{\hskip 1.0pt\text{--}\hskip 1.0pt})^{\sharp}:A\to\sharp A$ is a embedding (i.e. a $(-1)$-truncated map).
Definition 6.12. A crisp type $A::\mathsf{Type}$ is discrete if $(\mathord{\hskip 1.0pt\text{--}\hskip 1.0pt})_{\flat}:\flat A\to A$ is an equivalence.
Definition 13. Suppose given a kind $\mathcal{K}$ of structure on family of sets indexed by a collection $\Lambda$. Then a theorization of $\mathcal{K}$-structure is a virtualization of a relaxation of a categorification of $\mathcal{K}$-structure.
Definition 9. Suppose given a kind of structure $\mathcal{K}$ definable on a family indexed by a collection $\Lambda$, of sets, with forgetful functor $F\colon\mathcal{K}\to\mathrm{Fam}_{\Lambda}(\mathrm{Set})$. Then a kind of structure $\overline{\mathcal{K}}$ on family of categories indexed by $\Lambda$, with forgetful functor $\overline{F}\colon\overline{\mathcal{K}}\to\mathrm{Fam}(\mathrm{Cat})$ (of categories enriched in groupoids) is a categorification of $\mathcal{K}$-structure, if there is given a Cartesian square $\tikzcd\mathcal{K}\arrow{d}[swap]{F}\arrow{r}&\overline{\mathcal{K}}\arrow{d}{% \overline{F}}\\ \mathrm{Fam}_{\Lambda}(\mathrm{Set})\arrow[hook]{r}&\mathrm{Fam}_{\Lambda}(% \mathrm{Cat}).$ Namely, we say that such a square exhibits $\overline{\mathcal{K}}$-structure as a categorification of $\mathcal{K}$-structure.
Definition 12. Fix a collection $\Lambda$ for indexing families, and consider the groupoid-enriched category $\mathrm{Fam}(\mathrm{Cat})=\mathrm{Fam}_{\Lambda}(\mathrm{Cat})$ formed by families of categories indexed by $\Lambda$. Suppose given two kinds $\mathcal{K}$, $\overline{\mathcal{K}}$ of structure on object of $\mathrm{Fam}(\mathrm{Cat})$, with respective forgetful (enriched) functors $F\colon\mathcal{K}\to\mathrm{Fam}(\mathrm{Cat})$ and $\overline{F}\colon\overline{\mathcal{K}}\to\mathrm{Fam}(\mathrm{Cat})$. Suppose further given a functor $T\colon\mathcal{K}\to\overline{\mathcal{K}}$ of enriched categories over $\mathrm{Fam}(\mathrm{Cat})$ (see Remark 7, to be technical). Then • $\overline{\mathcal{K}}$-structure is said to be a relaxation of $\mathcal{K}$-structure if $T$ is fully faithful on the underlying $2$-groupoids, and $\mathcal{K}$-structures are characterized among $\overline{\mathcal{K}}$-structures as those in which some specific structure $2$-maps (see above) are invertible, • $\overline{\mathcal{K}}$-structure is said to be a virtualization of $\mathcal{K}$-structure if $T$ is fully faithful on the underlying $2$-groupoids, and $\mathcal{K}$-structures are characterized among $\overline{\mathcal{K}}$-structures as those in which some specific structure bimodules are corepresentable. Namely, we say that $T$ exhibits $\overline{\mathcal{K}}$-structure as a relaxation or virtualization if one of these conditions are satisfied.
Definition 8. Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a category. Then a kind of structure on an object of $\mathcal{C}$, is given by a pair consisting of • a category $\mathcal{K}$, to be called the category “of structured objects”, and • a functor $F\colon\mathcal{K}\to\mathcal{C}$, to be called the forgetful functor. We call a structure of the kind specified by these data a $\mathcal{K}$-structure (while remembering $F$).
Definition 14. We will say that a functor $\textgoth{h}:G_{1}\rightarrow G_{2}$ is a homomorphism if $G_{1},G_{2}$ are groups.
Definition 8. The following poperties define $\mathcal{U}$. 1) $\mathcal{A|}\mathbb{Z}\subseteq\mathcal{U}$ 2) $x\in A\in\mathcal{U}\Rightarrow x\in\mathcal{U}$ 3) $A\subseteq B\in\mathcal{U}\Rightarrow A\in\mathcal{U}$ 4) $A,B\in\mathcal{U}\Rightarrow A\rightarrow_{\times}B\in\mathcal{U}$ 5) $A\in\mathcal{U}\Rightarrow\textgoth{P}A\in\mathcal{U}$ 6) $\mathcal{X}\in\mathcal{U}\Rightarrow\bigcup\mathcal{X}\in\mathcal{U}$ 7) If a function $f:A\rightarrow B\subseteq\mathcal{U}$ is onto and $A\in\mathcal{U}$, then $B\in\mathcal{U}$.
Definition 5. A functor $\textgoth{F}:\mathcal{C}\rightarrow\mathcal{D}$ is a two part function $\textgoth{F}_{\mathcal{O}},\textgoth{F}_{\mathcal{A}}:\mathcal{O|C},\mathcal{A% |C}\rightarrow\mathcal{O|D},\mathcal{A|D}$ such that for every arrow $f:a\rightarrow b$, we have 1) $\textgoth{1}_{\mathcal{D}},\textgoth{1}_{\mathcal{C}};\textgoth{F}_{\mathcal{A% }},\textgoth{F}_{\mathcal{O}}$ Preserves Unit 2) $a,b;\textgoth{F}_{\mathcal{O}}a,\textgoth{F}_{\mathcal{O}}b$ Preserves Objects 3) $\textgoth{F}_{\mathcal{A}},\textgoth{F}_{\mathcal{A}};*\textgoth{F}_{\mathcal{% O}}f,*f$ Preserves Composition
Definition 4. Two arrows $f,g:x\rightarrow b$, of the same category, are the same arrow if for every arrow $h:a\rightarrow x$ and $i:b\rightarrow y$ we verify $f,h;g,h$ and $i,g;i,f$.
Definition 7. A bridge $\tau:\textgoth f\rightarrow\textgoth g$ is a natural transformation if for every arrow $f:a\rightarrow b$, in $\mathcal{C}$, we have $\tau b,\tau a;\textgoth g\leavevmode\nobreak\ f,\textgoth f\leavevmode\nobreak\ f$ in terms of composition for $\mathcal{D}$.
Definition 12. If $\mathcal{B},\mathcal{C}\in\textbf{FB}X$ are such that for every $B\in\mathcal{B}$ there is $C\in\mathcal{C}$ such that $C\subseteq B$ then we say $\mathcal{C}$ is finer than $\mathcal{B}$, or that $\mathcal{C}$ is a refinement of $\mathcal{B}$. This is represented by $\mathcal{B}\preceq\mathcal{C}$. A filter $\mathcal{F}$ is an ultrafilter if for every $A\subseteq X$ we have $A\in\mathcal{F}$ or $A^{c}\in\mathcal{F}$. The collection of ultrafilters on a set $X$ is $\textbf{UF}X$.
Definition 10. Let $x$ be any c-object of $\mathcal{C}$, and define the contravariant functor $\textgoth R^{\ltimes}_{x}:\mathcal{C}\rightarrow\textbf{Set}$, where $a\mapsto\{a\rightarrow x\}$; every arrow $f:a\rightarrow c$ is sent into the set function $*f:\{c\rightarrow x\}\rightarrow\{a\rightarrow x\}$, of Hom sets. Define the covariant functor $\textgoth L_{x}:\mathcal{C}\rightarrow\textbf{Set}$ such that $a\mapsto\{x\rightarrow a\}$, so that $f$ is sent into a set function $f*:\{x\rightarrow a\}\rightarrow\{x\rightarrow c\}$.
Definition 16. Let $\mathbb{K}(+,\cdot)$ be a field and $V_{\mathcal{G}}(*)$ an abelian group. Represent the underlying set of $V_{\mathcal{G}}$ with $V$ and recall that $\{V_{\mathcal{G}}\textgoth F_{iso}V_{\mathcal{G}}\}$ is the group of automorphisms for $V_{\mathcal{G}}$. Let $\mathbb{K}(\cdot)$ be the group under the product, for the field, and suppose there is a homomorphism $\bar{*}:\mathbb{K}(\cdot)\rightarrow\{V_{\mathcal{G}}\textgoth F_{iso}V_{% \mathcal{G}}\}$, such that $a+b;(a\bar{*}u)*(b\bar{*}u),u.$ This last condition means $(a+b)\bar{*}u$ is the same as $(a\bar{*}u)*(b\bar{*}u)$ where $a,b\in\mathbb{K}$ and $u\in V_{\mathcal{G}}$. The abelian group $V_{\mathcal{G}}$, together with the homomorphism $\bar{*}:\mathbb{K}(\cdot)\rightarrow\{V_{\mathcal{G}}\textgoth F_{iso}V_{% \mathcal{G}}\}$ forms a linear space.
Definition 2. A pair of functions $f,g$, as mentioned above, is called a Galois connection if 1) $f,g$ are order preserving, and 2) for every object $p$ in $\mathcal{P}$ and $q$ in $\mathcal{Q}$ we have $p\leq gfp$ and $fgq\leq q$.
Definition 13. Define the operation $\square:G\rightarrow GfG$ such that $a\square b\mapsto(a*b)*(a^{-1}*b^{-1})$, for $a,b\in G$. The image of $b$, under $a\square$ is $[a,b]$ and we call it the commutator of $a,b$. In other words, the notation for $*$ expresses $a*b;[a,b],a^{-1}*b^{-1}$. The object $a$ is said to be commutable if $a\square:G\rightarrow G$ is the function into $e$. Define $Comm(G)$ as the subcollection of commutable objects and call it the center of $G$.
Definition 1. A function $\mathcal{P}\rightarrow\mathcal{Q}$ defined on the objects of these categories is said to preserve the order if for every arrow $a\leq b$ we also have $fa\preceq fb$; if instead of this, we have $fb\preceq fa$, then the function is said to be order reversing. We say an order preserving function is an order embedding if for every $fa\preceq fb$ we have $a\leq b$. An order embedding that is onto, is called order bijectivity.
Definition 3. A category is a system with objects of two kinds; the one kind are called c-objects, while the other kind is a collection of order arrows, for the collection of c-objects. Additionally, for any choice of c-objects $x,y$, and arrows $f:a\rightarrow x$ and $g:b\rightarrow y$, there is a reflexive arrow $1_{b},1_{x}$ such that 1) $1_{x};f,f$ and $g;g,1_{b}$ Unit 2) $g*,g*;*f,*f$ Associativity
Definition 17. A family $\mathcal{B}\subseteq\mathcal{O}$ is called a base of the topological system $Cl_{X}$ if for every $\emptyset\neq V\in\mathcal{O}$ we have $V=\bigcup(\mathcal{O}^{V}\cap\mathcal{B})$. If $x\in U\in\mathcal{B}$, we say $U$ is a base-neighborhood of $x$. The subset $N$ is called a neighborhood of $x$ if there exists $V\in\mathcal{O}$ such that $x\in V\subseteq N$. A family $\mathcal{B}_{x}\subseteq\mathcal{O}$ is a point base of $x$ if for every neighborhood $N$ of $x$, there exists $U\in\mathcal{B}_{x}$ such that $x\in U\subseteq N$.
Definition 9. A set is any object of $\mathcal{U}$. A set function is any function $f:A\rightarrow B$, where $A,B\in\mathcal{U}$.
Definition 11. Let $I,J\subseteq\mathbb{Z}$, then we say the function $(a_{i}^{j})_{i,j}:J\times I\subseteq\mathbb{Z}^{2}_{\leq}\rightarrow A$ is a matrix for the objects of $A$. If $i,j\in I,J$ respectively, then the image of $\frac{j}{i}$, under the matrix, is represented by $a^{j}_{i}$. A matrix is said to be finite if $I,J$ are bijective to sets $\textbf{m},\textbf{n}\subseteq{N}$ respectively. The matrix is regular if it is of the special form $\textbf{m}\times\textbf{n}\rightarrow A$, that is, if $I=\textbf{m}$ and $J=\textbf{n}$. In any case, we say the matrix is of order $m\times n$. If we restrict the matrix to one of the sets $\textbf{m}\times\{j\}$, then we have a matrix $(a_{i}^{j})_{i}=(a_{i}^{j})_{i,j}|_{\textbf{m}\times\{j\}}$, of the form $\textbf{m}\times\{j\}\rightarrow A$ and we say $(a_{i}^{j})_{i}$ is the j-th column of the matrix $(a_{i}^{j})_{i,j}$. A similar remark holds for the restriction of $(a_{i}^{j})_{i,j}$ to a set $\{i\}\times\textbf{n}$; in this case we say $(a_{i}^{j})_{j}$ is the i-th row of $(a_{i}^{j})_{i,j}$.
Definition 6. A functor $\textgoth F$ is an isomorphism between $\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathcal{D}$ if $\textgoth F_{\mathcal{O}}$ and $\textgoth F_{\mathcal{A}}$ are bijections. An isomorphism from one category to itself is called an automorphism.
Definition 15. A group $G$, with operation $*$, is an action group of $X$ if there exists a homomorphism $\bar{*}$ from G into the group of transformations of X. We will write $a\mapsto a\bar{*}$ to represent the images. The null space of $\bar{*}$ is called the nucleus of non-effectivity for $G$. If $\bar{*}$ is an isomorphism, then we will say $G$ is an effective action group of $X$. An action group is called transitive if for every $x,y\in X$ there exists $a\in G$ such that $x;y,a\bar{*}$. Let $f:X\rightarrow Y$ be a bijective set function and $\textgoth{f}:G\rightarrow H$ an isomorphism such that $G,H$ is an action group of $X,Y$, and the operations are $*_{1},*_{2}$. If $f,f;\textgoth{f}a\bar{*}_{2},a\bar{*}_{1}$ we say $(X,G)$ and $(Y,H)$ are similar pairs. All that is being said is $f(a\bar{*}_{1}x)$ and $(\textgoth{f}a)\bar{*}_{2}(fx)$ are the same object, for every $x\in X$.
Definition 4.3. A (left) action of a groupoid $\Gamma=\{\Gamma_{1}\rightrightarrows\Gamma_{o}\}$ on a set $M$ consists of a map $\alpha:M\to\Gamma_{0}$ called the anchor and a map $a:\Gamma_{1}\times_{\mathfrak{s},\Gamma_{0},\alpha}M\to M,\qquad a(\gamma,m)=% \gamma\cdot m$ called the action so that (1) $a(\gamma\cdot m)=\mathfrak{t}(\gamma)$ for all $\gamma\in\Gamma_{1}$ and $m\in M$ with $\mathfrak{s}(\gamma)=a(m)$; (2) the identity arrows act trivially: $1_{\alpha(m)}\cdot m=m$ for all $m\in M$; and (3) $\tau\cdot(\gamma\cdot m)=(\tau\gamma)\cdot m$ for any two composable arrows $\tau,\gamma$ and any point $m\in M$ with $\mathfrak{s}(\gamma)=\alpha(m)$. Here, as before, $\mathfrak{t}$ and $\mathfrak{s}$ are the target and the source maps of the groupoid $\Gamma$, respectively.
Definition 6.3. Let ${\mathcal{X}}$ be a stack over $\mathsf{{Man}}$ and $G$ a Lie group. We define the category of parallel transport functors over the stack ${\mathcal{X}}$ to be the functor category $[{\mathcal{X}},\underline{\mathsf{Trans}}_{G}]$. In particular a parallel transport functor on a stack ${\mathcal{X}}$ is a 1-morphism of stacks $T:{\mathcal{X}}\to\underline{\mathsf{Trans}}_{G}$.
Definition 2.12. Let $M$ be a manifold. We define the thin fundamental group ${\pi_{1}^{\mathrm{thin}}}(M,x)$ of $M$ at a point $x\in M$ to be automorphism group of $x$ in the groupoid $\Pi^{\mathrm{thin}}(M)$: ${\pi_{1}^{\mathrm{thin}}}(M,x):=\mathfrak{s}^{-1}(x)\cap\mathfrak{t}(x);$ it is the group of thin homotopy classes of loops at $x$ in $M$.
Definition A.6 (Subspace diffeology). Let $(X,D_{X})$ be a diffeological space and $Y\subset X$ a subset. The subspace diffeology $D_{Y}$ is the set: $D_{Y}:=\{(p:U\to X)\in D_{X}\mid p(U)\subset Y\}$
Definition 3.9. Let $\pi:P\to M$ be a principal $G$-bundle with a connection 1-form $A$ and $\gamma:[a,b]\to M$ a path (a smooth curve). The horizontal lift of $\gamma$ with respect to $A$ is a curve $\gamma^{A}_{z}:[a,b]\to P$ with the following three properties: (1) $\pi\circ\gamma^{A}_{z}=\gamma$; (2) $\gamma^{A}_{z}(a)=z$; and (3) $\frac{d}{dt}\gamma^{A}_{z}(t)\in\ker\left(A_{\gamma^{A}_{z}(t)}\right)$ for all $t\in[a,b]$. The parallel transport along the path $\gamma:[a,b]\to M$ defined by $A$ is a $G$-equivariant diffeomorphism (i.e., a map of $G$-torsors) $||^{A}_{\gamma}:P_{\gamma(a)}\to P_{\gamma(b)}.$ It is defined by $||^{A}_{\gamma}(z):=\gamma^{A}_{z}(b).$ for all $z\in P_{\gamma(a)}$.
Definition A.13 (Diffeology, as a sheaf). Let $*$ be the one element set $\mathbb{R}^{0}.$ A diffeology $D=D_{X}$ on a set $X$ is a subsheaf of the sheaf $\underline{X}$, defined in Example A.11, such that $D(*)=\underline{X}(*)$.
Definition 4.18. Let ${\mathcal{G}}$ be a diffeological group. A diffeological space ${\mathscr{P}}$ is a principal ${\mathcal{G}}$-bundle over a manifold $M$ if the following three conditions hold: (1) there is a surjective map $\varpi:{\mathscr{P}}\to M$ which has local sections: for any point $x\in M$, there is a neighborhood $U$ of $M$ and a smooth section $\sigma:U\to{\mathscr{P}}$ of $\varpi$; (2) there is smooth right action of ${\mathcal{G}}$ on ${\mathscr{P}}$; (3) the map $\psi:{\mathscr{P}}\times{\mathcal{G}}\to{\mathscr{P}}\times_{\varpi,M,\varpi}{% \mathscr{P}}$ given by $\psi(z,g):=(z,z\cdot g)$ is an isomorphism of diffeological spaces.
Definition A.8. A (set-valued) presheaf ${\mathcal{R}}$ on a category $\mathsf{Open}$ is a contravariant functor from $\mathsf{Open}$ to the category $\mathsf{Set}$ of sets: ${\mathcal{R}}:\mathsf{Open}^{op}\to\mathsf{Set}.$
Definition 4.6 (The functor $\mathsf{rep}:B^{p}G(M)\to\mathrm{Trans}_{G}(M)$). Given an action $a:{\mathcal{P}}(M)/_{\sim}\times_{M}P\to P$ of the thin fundamental groupoid $\Pi^{\mathrm{thin}}(M)$ on a principal $G$-bundle $P\to M$, define the associated transport functor $\mathsf{rep}(a):\Pi^{\mathrm{thin}}(M)\to{G\text{-}\mathsf{tors}}$ by $\mathsf{rep}(a)\,(x\xrightarrow{[\gamma]}y):=P_{x}\xrightarrow{[\gamma]\cdot-}% P_{y}.$ Here $[\gamma]\cdot-$ denotes the action of $[\gamma]$ on the points of the fiber $P_{x}$. Given two actions $a$ and $a^{\prime}$ on principal $G$-bundles $P$ and $P^{\prime}$ over $M$ and a $(\Pi^{\mathrm{thin}}(M)\times G)$-equivariant map $f:P\to P^{\prime}$, define a natural isomorphism $\mathsf{rep}(f):\mathsf{rep}(a)\Rightarrow\mathsf{rep}(a^{\prime})$ by $\mathsf{rep}(f)_{x}:=f|_{P_{x}}:P_{x}\to P^{\prime}_{x}$ for all $x\in M$.
Definition 3.2 (The category ${G\text{-}\mathsf{tors}}$ of $G$-torsors). Fix a Lie group $G$. The collection of all $G$-torsors form a category: by definition a morphism from a torsor $X$ to a torsor $Y$ is a $G$-equivariant map $f:X\to Y$. We denote the category of $G$-torsors by ${G\text{-}\mathsf{tors}}$. Note that ${G\text{-}\mathsf{tors}}$ is a groupoid. We denote the set of morphisms in ${G\text{-}\mathsf{tors}}$ from a torsor $X$ to a torsor $Y$ by $\mathsf{Hom}_{G\text{-}\mathsf{tors}}(X,Y)$.
Definition A.1 (Diffeology). A diffeology on a set $X$ is a collection of functions $D_{X}\subset\{f:U\rightarrow X\ |\ U\subset\mathbb{R}^{n}\ \textrm{open},\ n% \in\mathbb{N}\}$ satisfying the following three conditions: (1) every constant map is in $D_{X}$; (2) if $V\subset\mathbb{R}^{m}$ is open, $f:U\to X$ is in $D_{X}$, and $g:V\to U$ is a smooth map, then the composite $f\circ g:V\to X$ is also in $D_{X}$; (3) if $\{U_{i}\}$ is an open cover of $U\subset\mathbb{R}^{n}$ and $f:U\to X$ is a map of sets such that $f|_{U_{i}}\to X$ is in $D_{X}$, then $f:U\to X$ is in $D_{X}.$ The pair $(X,D_{X})$ is called a diffeological space, and the elements of $D_{X}$ are called plots.
Definition A.23 (Diffeology on the space of thin homotopy classes of paths). As before, denote the set of thin homotopy classes of paths with sitting instances in a manifold $M$ by ${\mathcal{P}}(M)/_{\sim}$. We define the diffeology on ${\mathcal{P}}(M)/_{\sim}$ to be the quotient diffeology induced by the map ${\mathcal{P}}(M)\to{\mathcal{P}}(M)/_{\sim}$.
Definition 6.1. Let $G$ be a Lie group. A principal $G$-bundle over a stack ${\mathcal{X}}\to\mathsf{{Man}}$ is a a 1-morphism of stacks $p:{\mathcal{X}}\to BG$, where $BG$ denotes the stack of principal $G$ bundles.
Definition 3.15 (The category $\mathrm{Trans}_{G}(M)$ of $G$-transport functors). Fix a Lie group $G$ and a manifold $M$. Transport functors on $M$ form a category $\mathrm{Trans}_{G}(M)$: the objects are transport functors (q.v. Definition 3.5) and morphism are arbitrary (!) natural transformations.
Definition 2.1 (A path with sitting instances). Let $[a,b]\subset\mathbb{R}$ be a closed interval and $M$ a manifold. A smooth map $\gamma:[a,b]\to M$ is a path with sitting instances if $\gamma$ is constant on neighborhoods of $a$ and $b$.
Definition 2.4 (Thin homotopy). Two paths $\gamma_{0},\gamma_{1}:[0,1]\to M$ with sitting instances and the same endpoints in a manifold $M$ are thinly homotopic relative endpoints if there is a thin homotopy between them. That is, if there is a smooth map $H:[0,1]^{2}\to M$ with the following properties: (1) $H$ is a smooth homotopy from $\gamma_{0}$ to $\gamma_{1}$ relative the endpoints: $H(s,0)=\gamma_{0}(s),\quad H(s,1)=\gamma_{1}(s)\quad\textrm{for all }s\in[0,1]$ and $H(0,t)=\gamma_{0}(0)=\gamma_{1}(0),\quad H(1,t)=\gamma_{0}(1)=\gamma_{1}(1)% \quad\textrm{for all }t\in[0,1];$ (2) $H$ is “thin”: $\mathsf{rank}(dH)_{(s,t)}\leq 1$ for all $(s,t)\in[0,1]^{2}$; (3) $H$ has sitting instances near the boundary of the square: $H(s,t)$ is constant in $s$ for all $(s,t)$ near $\{0,1\}\times[0,1]$ and is constant in $t$ for all all $(s,t)$ near $[0,1]\times\{0,1\}$. We refer to $H$ as a thin homotopy from $\gamma_{0}$ to $\gamma_{1}$.
Definition 6.2. Let ${\mathcal{X}}$ be a stack over $\mathsf{{Man}}$ and $G$ a Lie group. We define the category of principal $G$ bundles with connection over the stack ${\mathcal{X}}$ to be the functor category $[{\mathcal{X}},B^{\nabla}G]$. In particular a principal bundle with connection over a stack ${\mathcal{X}}$ is a 1-morphism of stacks $F:{\mathcal{X}}\to B^{\nabla}G$.
Definition A.24 (q.v. [11, 8.3]). A diffeological groupoid $\Gamma$ is a groupoid object in the category $\mathsf{Diffeol}$ of diffeological spaces. That is, the sets of objects and arrows, $\Gamma_{0}$ and $\Gamma_{1},$ are diffeological spaces, and the structure maps $\mathfrak{s},\mathfrak{t},\mathfrak{m},\mathfrak{i},$ and $\mathfrak{u}$ (q.v. Notation 2.10) are maps of diffeological spaces.
Definition A.4. A map of diffeological spaces or a smooth map from a diffeological space $(X,D_{X})$ to a space $(Y,D_{Y})$ is a map of sets $f:X\to Y$ such that for any plot $p:U\to X$ in $D_{X}$, the composite $f\circ p$ is in $D_{Y}$.
Definition 3.5 (Transport functor). Let $M$ be manifold. A functor $F:\Pi^{\mathrm{thin}}(M)\to{G\text{-}\mathsf{tors}}$ is a (parallel) transport functor if, for every point $x\in M$, the map $F|_{{\pi_{1}^{\mathrm{thin}}}(M,x)}:{\pi_{1}^{\mathrm{thin}}}(M,x)\to\mathrm{% Aut}(F(x))$ is a map of diffeological spaces (see Definition A.4).
Definition A.12. A presheaf ${\mathcal{R}}:\mathsf{Open}^{op}\to\mathsf{Set}$ is subpresheaf of a presheaf ${\mathcal{S}}:\mathsf{Open}^{op}\to\mathsf{Set}$ if for every open set $U\in\mathsf{Open}$ ${\mathcal{R}}(U)\subset{\mathcal{S}}(U).$
Definition 4.8 (the functor $\mathsf{tp}:B^{\nabla}G(M)\to B^{p}G(M)$). Given a principal $G$-bundle with connection $(P,A)$ define an action $\mathsf{tp}(P,A):{\mathcal{P}}(M)/_{\sim}\times_{M}P\to P$ of $\Pi^{\mathrm{thin}}(M)$ on $P$ by $\mathsf{tp}(P,A)([\gamma],z):=||_{\gamma}^{A}(z)$ for all $([\gamma],z)\in{\mathcal{P}}(M)/_{\sim}\times_{M}P$ (q.v. Lemma 4.5). Equation (3.4) implies that a map $f:(P,A)\to(P^{\prime},A^{\prime})$ of principal $G$-bundles with connection intertwines the actions $\mathsf{tp}(P,A)$ and $\mathsf{tp}(P^{\prime},A^{\prime})$. Hence $f:P\to P^{\prime}$ is also a morphism in $B^{p}G(M)$.
Definition A.10. A presheaf ${\mathcal{S}}:\mathsf{Open}^{op}\to\mathsf{Set}$ is a sheaf if for any open set $U\in\mathsf{Open}$, any open cover $\{U_{i}\}_{i\in I}$ of $U$, and any collection of elements $s_{i}\in{\mathcal{S}}(U_{i})$ with $s_{i}|_{U_{i}\cap U_{j}}=s_{j}|_{U_{i}\cap U_{j}},$ there exists a unique element $s\in{\mathcal{S}}(U)$ with $s|_{U_{i}}=s_{i}.$
Definition 4.4. Fix a Lie group $G$ and a manifold $M$. The category of $B^{p}G(M)$ of principal $G$-bundles over $M$ with smooth actions of the thin fundamental groupoid $\Pi^{\mathrm{thin}}(M)$ is defined as follows: the objects are smooth (left) actions $a:{\mathcal{P}}(M)/_{\sim}\times P\to P$ of $\Pi^{\mathrm{thin}}(M)$ on principal $G$-bundles $P\to M$ that commute with the right actions of $G$. Morphisms are $\Pi^{\mathrm{thin}}(M)\times G$-equivariant maps. That is, they are maps $f:P\to P^{\prime}$ of principal $G$-bundles so that $f([\gamma]\cdot z)=[\gamma]\cdot f(z)$ for all $([\gamma],z)\in{\mathcal{P}}(M)/_{\sim}\times P$.
