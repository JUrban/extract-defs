Definition 3.1.1. 1. We will say that a triangulated category $\underline{C}$ is (co)smashing if it is closed with respect to (small) coproducts (resp., products). 2. We will say that a weight structure $w$ on $\underline{C}$ is (co)smashing if $\underline{C}$ is (co)smashing and the class $\underline{C}_{w\geq 0}$ is closed with respect to $\underline{C}$-coproducts (resp., $\underline{C}_{w\leq 0}$ is closed with respect to $\underline{C}$-products; cf. Proposition 1.2.4(3)). 3. We will say that a $t$-structure $t$ on $\underline{C}$ is (co)smashing if $\underline{C}$ is (co)smashing and the class $\underline{C}_{t\leq 0}$ is closed with respect to $\underline{C}$-coproducts (resp., $\underline{C}_{t\geq 0}$ is closed with respect to $\underline{C}$-products; cf. Remark 1.1.3(3)). 4. It will be convenient for us to use the following somewhat clumsy terminology: a cohomological functor $H^{\prime}$ from $\underline{C}$ into $\underline{A}$ will be called a cp functor if it converts all (small) coproducts into $\underline{A}$-products. 5. For an infinite cardinal $\alpha$ a homological functor $H:\underline{C}\to\underline{A}$ is said to be $\alpha$-small if for any family $N_{i}$, $i\in I$, we have $H(\coprod_{i\in I}N_{i})=\operatorname{\varinjlim}_{J\subset I,\ \#J<\alpha}H(% \coprod_{j\in J}N_{j})$ (i.e., the obvious morphisms $H(\coprod_{j\in J}N_{j})\to H(\coprod N_{i})$ form a colimit diagram; note that this colimit is filtered).
Definition 2.1.3. Let $m,n\in{\mathbb{Z}}$; let $H$ be as above. Then we will say that $H$ is of weight range $\geq m$ (resp. $\leq n$, resp. $[m,n]$) if it annihilates $\underline{C}_{w\leq m-1}$ (resp. $\underline{C}_{w\geq n+1}$, resp. both of these classes).
Definition 1.2.2. Let $i,j\in{\mathbb{Z}}$; assume that a triangulated category $\underline{C}$ is endowed with a weight structure $w$. 1. The full category ${\underline{Hw}}\subset\underline{C}$ whose objects are $\underline{C}_{w=0}=\underline{C}_{w\geq 0}\cap\underline{C}_{w\leq 0}$ is called the heart of $w$. 2. $\underline{C}_{w\geq i}$ (resp. $\underline{C}_{w\leq i}$, resp. $\underline{C}_{w=i}$) will denote the class $\underline{C}_{w\geq 0}[i]$ (resp. $\underline{C}_{w\leq 0}[i]$, resp. $\underline{C}_{w=0}[i]$). 3. $\underline{C}_{[i,j]}$ denotes $\underline{C}_{w\geq i}\cap\underline{C}_{w\leq j}$.6If $i>j$ and $M\in\underline{C}_{[i,j]}$ then $M\perp M$ by the orthogonality axiom; thus $\underline{C}_{[i,j]}=\{0\}$. 4. Let $\underline{D}$ be a full triangulated subcategory of $\underline{C}$. We will say that $w$ restricts to $\underline{D}$ whenever the couple $w_{\underline{D}}=(\underline{C}_{w\leq 0}\cap\operatorname{Obj}\underline{D},% \ \underline{C}_{w\geq 0}\cap\operatorname{Obj}\underline{D})$ is a weight structure on $\underline{D}$. Moreover, in this case we will also say that $w$ is an extension of $w_{\underline{D}}$. 5. We will say that $M$ is left (resp., right) $w$-degenerate (or weight-degenerate if the choice of $w$ is clear) if $M$ belongs to $\cap_{i\in{\mathbb{Z}}}\underline{C}_{w\geq i}$ (resp. to $\cap_{i\in{\mathbb{Z}}}\underline{C}_{w\leq i}$). 6. We will say that $w$ is left (resp., right) non-degenerate if all left (resp. right) weight-degenerate objects of $\underline{C}$ are zero. 7. We will call $\cup_{i\in{\mathbb{Z}}}\underline{C}_{w\geq i}$ (resp. $\cup_{i\in{\mathbb{Z}}}\underline{C}_{w\leq i}$) the class of $w$-bounded below (resp., $w$-bounded above) objects of $\underline{C}$. Moreover, we will say that $w$ is bounded below (resp. bounded above, resp. bounded) if all objects of $\underline{C}$ are bounded below (resp. bounded above, resp. are bounded both below and above). 8. We will say that a subcategory $\underline{H}\subset\underline{C}$ is negative (in $\underline{C}$) if $\operatorname{Obj}\underline{H}\perp(\cup_{i>0}\operatorname{Obj}(\underline{H% }[i]))$.
Definition 1.3.1. Assume that $\underline{C}$ and $\underline{C}^{\prime}$ are (full) triangulated subcategories of a triangulated category $\underline{D}$, $w$ is a weight structure on $\underline{C}$ and $t$ is a $t$-structure on $\underline{C}^{\prime}$ 1. We will say that $w$ is left orthogonal (or left $\underline{D}$-orthogonal) to $t$ or that $t$ is right orthogonal to $w$ whenever $\underline{C}_{w\leq 0}\perp_{\underline{D}}\underline{C}^{\prime}_{t\geq 1}$ and $\underline{C}_{w\geq 0}\perp_{\underline{D}}\underline{C}^{\prime}_{t\leq-1}$. 2. Dually, we will say that $w$ is right orthogonal (or right $\underline{D}$-orthogonal) to $t$ or that $t$ is left orthogonal to $w$ whenever $\underline{C}^{\prime}_{t\geq 1}\perp_{\underline{D}}\underline{C}_{w\leq 0}$ and $\underline{C}^{\prime}_{t\leq-1}\perp_{\underline{D}}\underline{C}_{w\geq 0}$. 3. If $\underline{C}=\underline{C}^{\prime}=\underline{D}$ and $w$ is left or right orthogonal to $t$ we will also say that $w$ is (left or right) adjacent to $t$. 4. We will say that $t$ is strictly right orthogonal to $w$ and $w$ is strictly left orthogonal to $t$ if $\underline{C}^{\prime}_{t\geq 1}=\underline{C}_{w\leq 0}^{\perp_{\underline{D}% }}\cap\operatorname{Obj}\underline{C}^{\prime}$ and $\underline{C}^{\prime}_{t\leq-1}={}^{\perp_{\underline{D}}}\underline{C}_{w% \geq 0}\cap\operatorname{Obj}\underline{C}^{\prime}$.
Definition 1.2.1. I. A pair of subclasses $\underline{C}_{w\leq 0},\underline{C}_{w\geq 0}\subset\operatorname{Obj}% \underline{C}$ will be said to define a weight structure $w$ on a triangulated category $\underline{C}$ if they satisfy the following conditions. (i) $\underline{C}_{w\leq 0}$ and $\underline{C}_{w\geq 0}$ are retraction-closed in $\underline{C}$ (i.e., contain all $\underline{C}$-retracts of their objects). (ii) Semi-invariance with respect to translations. $\underline{C}_{w\leq 0}\subset\underline{C}_{w\leq 0}[1]$, $\underline{C}_{w\geq 0}[1]\subset\underline{C}_{w\geq 0}$. (iii) Orthogonality. $\underline{C}_{w\leq 0}\perp\underline{C}_{w\geq 0}[1]$. (iv) Weight decompositions. For any $M\in\operatorname{Obj}\underline{C}$ there exists a distinguished triangle $L_{w}M\to M\to R_{w}M{\to}L_{w}M[1]$ such that $L_{w}M\in\underline{C}_{w\leq 0}$ and $R_{w}M\in\underline{C}_{w\geq 0}[1]$.
Definition 5.2.1. Let $\underline{A}$ be an abelian category. 1. We will call a (covariant) bi-functor $\Phi:\underline{C}^{op}\times\underline{C}^{\prime}\to\underline{A}$ a duality if it is bi-additive, homological with respect to both arguments, and is equipped with a (bi)natural bi-additive transformation $\Phi(-,-)\cong\Phi(-[1],-[1])$. 2. Suppose that $\underline{C}$ is endowed with a weight structure $w$, $\underline{C}^{\prime}$ is endowed with a $t$-structure $t$. Then we will say that $w$ is left orthogonal to $t$ and $t$ is right orthogonal to $w$ with respect to $\Phi$ if the following orthogonality condition is fulfilled: $\Phi(X,Y)=0$ if $X\in\underline{C}_{w\leq 0}$ and $Y\in\underline{C}^{\prime}_{t\geq 1}$ or if $X\in\underline{C}_{w\geq 0}$ and $Y\in\underline{C}^{\prime}_{t\leq-1}$. 3. Assume that $t$ is right orthogonal to $w$ with respect to $\Phi$. Then we will also say that $t$ is $-$-orthogonal (resp. $+$-orthogonal) to $w$ (with respect to $\Phi$) if for any $Y\in\operatorname{Obj}\underline{C}^{\prime}$ we have $Y\in\underline{C}^{\prime}_{t\leq-1}$ (resp. $Y\in\underline{C}^{\prime}_{t\geq 1}$) whenever $\Phi(X,Y)=0$ for all $X\in\underline{C}_{w\geq 0}$ (resp. $X\in\underline{C}_{w\leq 0}$). Moreover, we will say that $t$ is strictly right orthogonal to $w$ and $w$ is strictly left orthogonal to $t$ if $t$ is both $-$ and $+$-orthogonal to $w$. 4. We will write $P_{t}$ for the class of those $X\in\operatorname{Obj}\underline{C}$ such that $\Phi(X,Y)=0$ for all $Y\in\underline{C}^{\prime}_{t\leq-1}\cup\underline{C}^{\prime}_{t\geq 1}$ (cf. §3 of [NSZ19]); $P^{\prime}_{t}={}^{\perp_{\underline{C}^{\prime}}}(\underline{C}^{\prime}_{t% \leq-1}\cup\underline{C}^{\prime}_{t\geq 1})$.
Definition 2.2.1. Let $\underline{C}$ and $\underline{C}^{\prime}$ be (full) triangulated subcategories of a triangulated category $\underline{D}$ (cf. Definition 1.3.1). Then we will say that $\underline{C}$ reflects $\underline{C}^{\prime}$ (in the category $\underline{D}$) whenever the $\underline{D}$-Yoneda functor $\underline{C}^{\prime}\to\operatorname{\operatorname{AddFun}}(\underline{C}^{% op},\operatorname{Ab}):M\mapsto H_{M}$ (see Definition 2.1.1(3)) is fully faithful.
Definition 1.3. Let $\pazocal{X}$ be a sequence of sets with $\pazocal{X}(0)=\varnothing$. The map of operads $\sigma\colon\pazocal{T}^{sh}(\pazocal{X})\to\operatorname{Ass}^{sh}$ is the unique morphism of shuffle operads extending the sequence of maps $\sigma_{n}\colon\pazocal{X}(n)\to\operatorname{Ass}(n)$ with $(\sigma_{n}(x))=\operatorname{id}$. For an element $T\in\pazocal{T}(\pazocal{X})$, the element $\sigma(T)$ is called the permutation of $T$.
Definition 1.1 (Word operad). Suppose that $(M,\star)$ is a monoid. The species $\mathbb{W}_{M}$ is defined by the formula $\mathbb{W}_{M}(I)=M^{I}$. For each map $f\colon I\to\underline{n}$, we have a map $\gamma_{f}\colon\mathbb{W}_{M}(\underline{n})\times\mathbb{W}_{M}(f^{-1}(1))% \times\cdots\times\mathbb{W}_{M}(f^{-1}(n))\to\mathbb{W}_{M}(I)$ defined by the formula $\gamma_{f}(a;b_{1},\ldots,b_{n})(i):=a(f(i))\star b_{f(i)}(i).$ By a direct inspection, these maps satisfy the properties required of compositions in an operad. The resulting operad is called the word operad of $M$. We can also consider the associated shuffle word operad $\mathbb{W}_{M}^{sh}$, and the associated nonsymmetric word operad $\mathbb{W}_{M}^{ns}$.
Definition 1.5 (Ordered shuffle operad). A shuffle operad $\pazocal{O}$ is said to be ordered, if each component $\Gamma(n)$ is equipped with a partial order $\prec$ for which every structure map $\mu_{T}$ is an increasing function of its arguments: if we replace one of the arguments of any structure map $\mu_{T}(-;-,\ldots,-)$ by an element from the same component of $\pazocal{O}$ which is greater with respect to $\prec$, the result is also greater with respect to $\prec$.
Definition 1.2. Let $\pazocal{X}$ be a sequence of sets with $\pazocal{X}(0)=\varnothing$. We denote $\underline{\pazocal{X}}:=\bigsqcup\limits_{n\geq 1}\pazocal{X}(n),$ the union of all these sets taken together. We may consider the free shuffle operad $\pazocal{T}^{sh}(\pazocal{X})$ and the free monoid $T(\underline{\pazocal{X}})$. The map of operads $\theta\colon\pazocal{T}^{sh}(\pazocal{X})\to\mathbb{W}^{sh}_{T(\underline{% \pazocal{X}})}$ is the unique morphism of shuffle operads extending the sequence of maps $\theta_{n}\colon\pazocal{X}(n)\to T(\underline{\pazocal{X}})^{n}$ with $(\theta_{n}(x))_{k}=x$ for all $1\leq k\leq n$. For an element $T\in\pazocal{T}(\pazocal{X})$, the element $\theta(T)$ is called the path sequence of $T$.
2.1 Definition. Denote by $\mathcal{P}_{u,v}(S)_{+}$ the subcategory of $\mathcal{P}_{u,v}(S)$ generated by all objects of $\mathcal{P}_{u,v}(S)$ and by the inclusion maps. Denote by $\mathcal{P}_{u,v}(S)_{-}$ the subcategory of $\mathcal{P}_{u,v}(S)$ generated by all objects of $\mathcal{P}_{u,v}(S)$ and by the composition maps.
5.1 Definition. An execution path $\gamma$ of a multipointed $d$-space $X$ is stretched if • The restriction $\gamma\!\upharpoonright\!_{]0,1[}:]0,1[\to|X|$ is one-to-one. • $\gamma^{-1}(\{\gamma(0),\gamma(1)\})\subset\{0,1\}$.
2.3 Definition. An object $\underline{n}$ of the small category $\mathcal{P}_{u,v}(S)$ is simplifiable if the matching category $\partial(\underline{n}{\downarrow}\mathcal{P}_{u,v}(S)_{-})$ is nonempty.
3.5 Definition. The map $\gamma_{1}*\gamma_{2}$ is called the (Moore) composition of $\gamma_{1}$ and $\gamma_{2}$. The composite $\xymatrix@C=3em{\gamma_{1}*_{N}\gamma_{2}:[0,1]\ar@{->}[r]^{-}{(\mu_{2})^{-1}}% &[0,2]\ar@{->}[r]^{-}{\gamma_{1}*\gamma_{2}}&U}$ is called the (normalized) composition. The normalized composition being not associative, a notation like $\gamma_{1}*_{N}\dots*_{N}\gamma_{n}$ will mean, by convention, that $*_{N}$ is applied from the left to the right.
8.1 Definition. [Gau03b] A flow $X$ consists of a topological space $\mathbb{P}X$ of execution paths, a discrete space $X^{0}$ of states, two continuous maps $s$ and $t$ from $\mathbb{P}X$ to $X^{0}$ called the source and target map respectively, and a continuous and associative map $*:\{(x,y)\in\mathbb{P}X\times\mathbb{P}X;t(x)=s(y)\}\longrightarrow\mathbb{P}X$ such that $s(x*y)=s(x)$ and $t(x*y)=t(y)$. A morphism of flows $f:X\longrightarrow Y$ consists of a set map $f^{0}:X^{0}\longrightarrow Y^{0}$ together with a continuous map $\mathbb{P}f:\mathbb{P}X\longrightarrow\mathbb{P}Y$ such that $f(s(x))=s(f(x))$, $f(t(x))=t(f(x))$ and $f(x*y)=f(x)*f(y)$. The corresponding category is denoted by ${{\rm{\mathbf{Flow}}}}$. Let $\mathbb{P}_{\alpha,\beta}X=\{x\in\mathbb{P}X\mid s(x)=\alpha\hbox{ and }t(x)=\beta\}$.
3.6 Definition. [Gau09] A multipointed $d$-space $X$ is a triple $(|X|,X^{0},\mathbb{P}^{\mathcal{G}}X)$ where • The pair $(|X|,X^{0})$ is a multipointed space. • The set $\mathbb{P}^{\mathcal{G}}X$ is a set of continous maps from $[0,1]$ to $|X|$ called the execution paths, satisfying the following axioms: – For any execution path $\gamma$, one has $\gamma(0),\gamma(1)\in X^{0}$. – Let $\gamma$ be an execution path of $X$. Then any composite $\gamma\phi$ with $\phi\in\mathcal{G}$ is an execution path of $X$. – Let $\gamma_{1}$ and $\gamma_{2}$ be two composable execution paths of $X$; then the normalized composition $\gamma_{1}*_{N}\gamma_{2}$ is an execution path of $X$. A map $f:X\to Y$ of multipointed $d$-spaces is a map of multipointed spaces $|f|$ from $(|X|,X^{0})$ to $(|Y|,Y^{0})$ such that for any execution path $\gamma$ of $X$, the composite map $\mathbb{P}^{\mathcal{G}}(\gamma):=|f|\gamma$ is an execution path of $Y$. The category of multipointed $d$-spaces is denoted by ${{\rm{\mathbf{{\mathcal{G}}dTop}}}}$. The subset of execution paths from $\alpha$ to $\beta$ is the set of $\gamma\in\mathbb{P}^{\mathcal{G}}X$ such that $\gamma(0)=\alpha$ and $\gamma(1)=\beta$; it is denoted by $\mathbb{P}^{\mathcal{G}}_{\alpha,\beta}X$. It is equipped with the kelleyfication of the initial topology making the inclusion $\mathbb{P}^{\mathcal{G}}_{\alpha,\beta}X\subset{{\rm{\mathbf{TOP}}}}([0,1],|X|)$ is continuous. Let $\mathbb{P}^{\mathcal{G}}X:=\bigsqcup_{(\alpha,\beta)\in X^{0}\times X^{0}}% \mathbb{P}^{\mathcal{G}}_{\alpha,\beta}X.$
3.2 Definition. A multipointed space is a pair $(|X|,X^{0})$ where • $|X|$ is a topological space called the underlying space of $X$. • $X^{0}$ is a subset of $|X|$ called the set of states of $X$. A morphism of multipointed spaces $f:X=(|X|,X^{0})\rightarrow Y=(|Y|,Y^{0})$ is a commutative square $\xymatrix{X^{0}\ar@{->}[r]^{-}{f^{0}}\ar@{->}[d]_{-}{}&Y^{0}\ar@{->}[d]_{-}{}% \\ |X|\ar@{->}[r]^{-}{|f|}&|Y|.}$ The corresponding category is denoted by ${{\rm{\mathbf{MSpc}}}}$.
6.1 Definition. Let $X$ be a multipointed $d$-space. Let $\mathbb{P}^{\ell}_{\alpha,\beta}X$ be the subspace of continuous maps from $[0,\ell]$ to $|X|$ defined by $\mathbb{P}^{\ell}_{\alpha,\beta}X=\{t\mapsto\gamma\mu_{\ell}\mid\gamma\in% \mathbb{P}^{\mathcal{G}}_{\alpha,\beta}X\}.$ Its elements are called the execution paths of length $\ell$ from $\alpha$ to $\beta$. Let $\mathbb{P}^{\ell}X=\sum_{(\alpha,\beta)\in X^{0}\times X^{0}}\mathbb{P}^{\ell}% _{\alpha,\beta}X.$ A map of multipointed $d$-spaces $f:X\to Y$ induces for each $\ell>0$ a continuous map $\mathbb{P}^{\ell}f:\mathbb{P}^{\ell}X\to\mathbb{P}^{\ell}Y$ by composition by $f$.
Definition 1. 1. Let $M$ be a monoid and $X$ a right $M$-set. The theory for $(X,M)$-graphs, $\mathbb{G}_{(X,M)}$, is the category with two objects $V$ and $A$ and homsets given by $\displaystyle\mathbb{G}_{(X,M)}(V,A)\vcentcolon=X,$ $\displaystyle\mathbb{G}_{(X,M)}(A,V)\vcentcolon=\varnothing,$ $\displaystyle\mathbb{G}_{(X,M)}(V,V)\vcentcolon=\{\operatorname{id}_{V}\},$ $\displaystyle\mathbb{G}_{(X,M)}(A,A)\vcentcolon=M.$ Composition is defined as $m\circ x=x.m$ (the right-action via $M$), $m\circ m^{\prime}=m^{\prime}m$ (monoid operation of $M$). 2. Let $M$ be a monoid such that $\operatorname{Fix}(M)\vcentcolon=\left\{\,m^{\prime}\in M\,\middle|\,\forall m% \in M,m^{\prime}m=m^{\prime}\,\right\}$ is non-empty. Let $X\vcentcolon=\left\{\,x_{m^{\prime}}\,\middle|\,m^{\prime}\in\operatorname{Fix% }(M)\,\right\}$ be the right $M$-set with right-action $x_{m}.m^{\prime}\vcentcolon=x_{mm^{\prime}}$ for each $m\in M$ and $x_{m^{\prime}}\in X$. The theory for reflexive $(X,M)$-graphs, $\operatorname{r\mathbb G}_{(X,M)}$ is the same as for $\mathbb{G}_{(X,M)}$ but with $\displaystyle\operatorname{r\mathbb G}_{(X,M)}(A,V)\vcentcolon=\{\ell\},$ and composition $\ell\circ m=\ell$, $\ell\circ x_{m^{\prime}}=\operatorname{id}_{V}$, and $x\circ\ell=x$ for each $m\in M$ and $m^{\prime}\in\operatorname{Fix}(M)$. The category of $(X,M)$-graphs (resp. reflexive $(X,M)$-graphs) is defined to be the category of presheaves $\widehat{\mathbb{G}}_{(X,M)}\vcentcolon=[\mathbb{G}_{(X,M)}^{op},\mathbf{Set}]$ (resp. $\widehat{\operatorname{r\mathbb G}}_{(X,M)}\vcentcolon=[\operatorname{r\mathbb G% }_{(X,M)}^{op},\mathbf{Set}].$)
Definition 4.19. By a pseudo $\lambda$-wall $W_{u,v,s}$ we mean the subset of points $(\alpha,\beta)$ of a numerical $\lambda$-wall $\Upsilon_{u,v,s}$ for which (1) there are objects $E,F,G\in\mathcal{A}^{\alpha,\beta}$ satisfying $\operatorname{ch}(E)=v$, $\operatorname{ch}(F)=u$, $\operatorname{ch}(G)=v-u$; (2) $Q^{\text{tilt}}(u)\geq 0$, $Q^{\text{tilt}}(v-u)\geq 0$; (3) $Q_{\alpha,\beta}(u)\geq 0$, $Q_{\alpha,\beta}(v-u)\geq 0$.
Definition 5.9. A path $\gamma:(0,\infty)\to\mathbb{H}$ with $\gamma(t)=(\alpha(t),\beta(t))$ is called an unbounded $\Theta^{-}$-curve if $\lim_{t\to\infty}\beta(t)=-\infty$ and for all $v$ such that $v_{\leq 1}\neq(0,0)$, $\nu_{\gamma(t)}(v)>0$ for all $t$ sufficiently large. Equivalently, the curve is asymptotically bounded by $\Theta^{-}_{v}$, ie $\lim_{t\to\infty}\frac{\dot{\alpha}(t)}{\dot{\beta}(t)}>-1.$ We define the dual path $\gamma^{*}$ is defined to be $\gamma^{*}(t)=(\alpha(t),-\beta(t))$. Similarly, we define $\gamma$ to be an unbounded $\Theta^{+}$-curve if $\lim_{t\to\infty}\beta(t)=+\infty$ and for all $v$ such that $v_{\leq 1}\neq(0,0)$, $\nu_{\gamma(t)}(v)<0$ for all $t$ sufficiently large.
Definition 3.2. For any real numerical Chern character $v$ and $s\geq 0$, we define the curve $\Gamma_{v,s}:=\{(\alpha,\beta)\in\mathbb{H}\leavevmode\nobreak\ \mid% \leavevmode\nobreak\ \tau_{v,s}(\alpha,\beta)=0\}.$ In addition, we set $\Gamma_{v,s}^{\bullet}:=\Gamma_{v,s}\cap R_{v}^{\bullet}$, with $\bullet=-,0,+$.
Definition 7.1. An object $A\in D^{\rm b}(X)$ is asymptotically $\lambda_{\alpha,\beta,s}$-(semi)stable along $\gamma$ if the following two conditions hold for a given $s>0$: (i) there is $t_{0}>0$ such that $A\in\mathcal{A}^{\gamma(t)}$ for every $t>t_{0}$; (ii) for every sub-object $F\hookrightarrow A$ within $\mathcal{A}^{\gamma(t)}$ with $t>t_{0}$, there is $t_{1}>t_{0}$ such that $\lambda_{\gamma(t),s}(F)<\leavevmode\nobreak\ (\leq)\leavevmode\nobreak\ % \lambda_{\gamma(t),s}(A)$ for $t>t_{1}$.
Definition 4.2. A numerical $\nu$-wall $\Xi_{u,v}$ is called an actual $\nu$-wall if for some $(\alpha_{0},\beta_{0})\in\Xi_{u,v}$ there is an object $B\in\mathcal{B}^{\beta_{0}}$ with $\operatorname{ch}(B)=v$ and a $\nu_{\alpha_{0},\beta_{0}}$-semistable sub-object $F\hookrightarrow B$ with $\operatorname{ch}(F)=u$ such that the quotient $E/F$ is also $\nu_{\alpha_{0},\beta_{0}}$-semistable.
Definition 2.17. A torsion free sheaf $E$ on $X$ is said to be $\mu_{\leq 2}$-(semi)stable if every proper, nontrivial subsheaf $F\hookrightarrow E$ satisfies $(\delta_{10}(E,F),\delta_{20}(E,F))>\leavevmode\nobreak\ (\geq)\leavevmode% \nobreak\ 0$ in the lexicographic order.
Definition 6.1. Let $u$ and $v$ be real numerical Chern characters such that $v$ satisfies the Bogomolov inequality. We define the surface $\Sigma_{u,v}\subset\mathbb{R}^{+}\times\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}^{+}$ to be the vanishing locus of $f_{u,v}(\alpha,\beta,s)=\Delta_{32}(\alpha,\beta)-\alpha^{2}(s-1/3)\Delta_{12}% (\alpha,\beta),$ the numerator of the difference of slopes $\lambda_{\alpha,\beta,s}(u)-\lambda_{\alpha,\beta,s}(v)$ now regarded as a function of all three parameters $(\alpha,\beta,s)$. Note that $\Sigma_{u,v}=\Sigma_{v,u}=\Sigma_{\phi v+\psi u,v},$ for any real $\phi$ and $\psi\neq 0$.
Definition 3.5. Suppose $v_{0}\neq 0$ and $Q^{\rm tilt}(v)\geq 0$. We define the region $R^{L}_{v,s}$ to be $\{(\alpha,\beta)\in\mathbb{H}\mid\alpha<\alpha_{0},\text{ whenever }(\alpha_{0% },\beta)\in\Gamma^{-}_{v,s}\}\cap R^{-}_{v}.$ Alternatively, $R^{L}_{v,s}=\{(\alpha,\beta)\in\mathbb{H}\mid v_{0}\tau_{v,s}(\alpha,\beta)% \geq 0\}\cap R^{-}_{v}.$
Definition 5.1. An object $A\in D^{\rm b}(X)$ is asymptotically $\nu_{\alpha,\beta}$-(semi)stable along $\gamma$ if the following two conditions hold: (i) there is $t_{0}>0$ such that $A\in\mathcal{B}^{\gamma(t)}$ for every $t>t_{0}$; (ii) for every sub-object $F\hookrightarrow A$ within $\mathcal{B}^{\gamma(t)}$ with $t>t_{0}$, there is $t_{1}>t_{0}$ such that $\nu_{\gamma(t)}(F)<\leavevmode\nobreak\ (\leq)\leavevmode\nobreak\ \nu_{\gamma% (t)}(A)$ for $t>t_{1}$.
Definition 2.19. A torsion sheaf $T\in\mathcal{C}oh(X)_{2}$ on $X$ is said to be $\hat{\mu}$-(semi)stable if it is pure, and every subsheaf $U\subset T$ satisfies $\hat{\mu}(U):=\dfrac{u_{2}}{u_{1}}<\leavevmode\nobreak\ (\leq)\leavevmode% \nobreak\ \dfrac{\operatorname{ch}_{2}(T)}{\operatorname{ch}_{1}(T)}=\hat{\mu}% (T).$
Definition 4.16. An actual $\lambda$-wall $W_{u,v,s}$ is the subset of points $(\alpha,\beta)$ of a numerical $\lambda$-wall $\Upsilon_{u,v,s}$ for which there is an object $E\in\mathcal{A}^{\alpha,\beta}$ with $\operatorname{ch}(E)=v$ and a path $\gamma:(-1,1)\to\mathbb{R}_{>0}\times\mathbb{R}$ such that $\gamma(0)=(\alpha,\beta)$ and $E\in{\mathcal{A}}^{\gamma(t)}$ is $\lambda$-stable for $t<0$ and $\lambda$-unstable for $t>0$.
Definition 10.2.1. A broken cycle is the data of a topological space $C$ equipped with a continuous $\mathbb{R}$-action such that (C1) $C$ is abstractly homeomorphic to the circle $S^{1}$. (C2) The $\mathbb{R}$-action is directed, in that it induces an orientation on $S^{1}$, and (C3) The fixed point set $C^{\mathbb{R}}$ is discrete and non-empty.
Definition 5.3.1. Let $I$ be a paracyclic preorder and $L_{S}\to S$ a family of broken paracycles. An $I$-section is a map $\sigma:S\times I\to L_{S}^{\circ}$ such that (1) For each $i\in I$, the map $s\mapsto\sigma(s,i)$ is a continuous section, (2) For every $s\in S$, the map $I\to(L_{s}^{\circ})/\mathbb{R}$ is a surjection, (3) For every $s\in S$, if $i\geq i^{\prime}$ in $I$, then $d(\sigma(s,i),\sigma(s,i^{\prime}))>-\infty$ (see Notation 3.0.14), and (4) $\sigma$ is $\mathbb{Z}$-equivariant. That is, $\sigma(s,i+1)=\sigma(s,i)+1$.
Definition 3.0.10. An isomorphism of broken paracycles is an isomorphism of $(\mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{R})$-spaces—that is, a homeomorphism commuting with the $\mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{R}$ action.
Definition 8.4.1 (Exit path $\infty$-category). Let $X\to P$ be a conically stratified space (Definition 8.2.3). Then the exit path $\infty$-category of $X\to P$ is the pullback of simplicial sets $\xymatrix{\mathcal{E}\mathsf{xit}(X)\ar[rr]\ar[d]&&\mathrm{Sing}(X)\ar[d]\\ N(P)\ar[rr]^{-}{\text{Prop~{}\ref{prop:nerve-of-P-is-inside-sing(P)}}}&&% \mathrm{Sing}(P).}$ Here, the bottom horizontal arrow is the one supplied by Proposition 8.3.4. Note that the stratification is implicit in the notation $\mathcal{E}\mathsf{xit}(X)$, which has no mention of $P$.
Definition 4.1.1. A pair $(j_{!}F,\eta)$ is called a left Kan extension of $F$ along $j$ if it is initial among all such pairs. By abuse, we will often call $j_{!}F$ a left Kan extension, with the data of $\eta$ implicit.
Definition 9.1.1. Fix a subset $E\subset I\times I$. We write $iEj$ whenever $(i,j)\in E$.
Definition 8.2.1 (Stratification). Let $X$, be a topological space and $P$ a poset. A stratification on $X$ (by $P$) is the data of a continuous functions $X\to P$. In this work, we will call the data $X\to P$ a stratified space, or $P$-stratified space when the choice of $P$ is to be emphasized.
Definition 2.0.1. Recall that a parasimplex is the data $(I,\mu)$ of a totally ordered set $I$ equipped with an order-preserving $\mathbb{Z}$-action $\mu$ satisfying two conditions: (1) For any two elements $i\leq i^{\prime}$, the set of $i^{\prime\prime}$ satisfying $i\leq i^{\prime\prime}\leq i^{\prime}$ is finite, and (2) For every $i\in I$, we have $i<i+1$. (That is, for any $i$, the induced map $\mu(-,i):\mathbb{Z}\to I$ is order-preserving.) A map of parasimplices is a weakly order-preserving, $\mathbb{Z}$-equivariant map. This means a map is a function $f:I\to J$ such that $i\leq i^{\prime}\implies f(i)\leq f(i^{\prime})$ and $f(i+1)=f(i)+1$.
Definition 5.1.1 ($\mathsf{Broken}_{\circlearrowleft}$). We let $\mathsf{Broken}_{\circlearrowleft}$ be the stack classifying families of broken paracycles.
Definition 10.1.3. Likewise, the category of cyclic preorders $\mathsf{PreOrd_{\operatorname{cyc}}}$ is the category obtained by quotienting the hom-sets of $\mathsf{PreOrd_{\circlearrowleft}}$ by the obvious $\mathbb{Z}$-action.
Definition 5.2.3. We say that a map of preorders $r:I\to J$ is essentially surjective if the induced function $I/\sim_{I}\to J/\sim_{J}$ is a surjection.
Definition 3.0.2 (Broken line). A broken line is the data of a topological space together with a continuous $\mathbb{R}$-action such that (1) The fixed point set of $\mathbb{R}$ is discrete, and (2) There exists a homeomorphism $\phi$ to $[0,1]$ such that $\phi(x+t)\geq\phi(x)$ for all $t\geq 0$. (Here, $\geq$ is the usual order on $[0,1]$.) (In particular, any broken line is abstractly homeomorphic to a compact interval.)
Definition 8.2.6. We can define the (ordinary) category of conically stratified spaces as follows: An object is a conically stratified space $X\to P$. Given another conically stratified space $Y\to Q$, a morphism is the data of a commutative diagram $\xymatrix{X\ar[r]^{f}\ar[d]&Y\ar[d]\\ P\ar[r]^{r}&Q}$ where $f$ is a continuous map and $r$ is a map of posets.
Definition 3.1.4. A map of families of broken paracycles is a commutative diagram $\xymatrix{L_{S}\ar[r]^{\tilde{f}}\ar[d]&L_{T}\ar[d]\\ S\ar[r]^{f}&T}$ where $f$ is a continuous map, $\tilde{f}$ exhibits the space $L_{S}$ as the pullback of $L_{T}$ along $f$, and $\tilde{f}$ commutes with the $\mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{R}$ action. An isomorphism is a map such that $f$ (and hence $\tilde{f}$) is a homeomorphism.
Definition 8.5.4. A sheaf $\mathcal{F}$ on $X$ is called locally constant if there exists an open cover $\coprod_{\alpha}U_{\alpha}\to X$ such that the restriction of $\mathcal{F}$ to each $U_{\alpha}$ is a constant sheaf.
Definition 5.5.2. Let $\widetilde{\mathsf{Amalg}}$ denote the category whose objects are triplets $(I,J,K)$ where $K$ is an object of $\mathsf{Amalg}(I,J)$, and a morphism is a pair of $\mathbb{Z}$-equivariant maps of preorders $I\to I^{\prime},\qquad J\to J^{\prime}$ such that the induced map $K\to K^{\prime}$ is a map of preorders.
Definition 10.2.5. A map of families of broken cycles is a commutative diagram $\xymatrix{C_{S}\ar[r]^{\tilde{f}}\ar[d]&C_{T}\ar[d]\\ S\ar[r]^{f}&T}$ where $\tilde{f}$ is $\mathbb{R}$-equivariant, and exhibits $C_{S}$ as homeomorphic to the pullback $C_{T}\times_{T}S$.
Definition 4.3.2. Let $\mathcal{C}$ be an $\infty$-category and $W\subset\mathcal{C}$ a subcategory. The localization of $\mathcal{C}$ along $W$ is the pushout of $\infty$-categories $\xymatrix{W\ar[r]\ar[d]&\mathcal{C}\ar[d]\\ |W|\ar[r]&\mathcal{C}[W^{-1}]}$ where $|W|$ is the groupoid completion of $W$. (Notation 4.0.1.)
Definition 8.5.6. Let $X\to P$ be a stratified space and let $\mathcal{F}$ be a sheaf on $X$. We say that $\mathcal{F}$ is constructible (with respect to the stratification on $X$) if for every $p\in P$, the restriction $\mathcal{F}|_{X_{p}}$ is a locally constant sheaf on $X_{p}$.
