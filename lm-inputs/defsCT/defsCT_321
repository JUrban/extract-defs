Definition 3.4. Let $(S,d)\in\mathbf{\mathcal{L}}_{qm}$. An element $x\in S$ is called: 1. fully invariant if $x$ is $\phi$-invariant for every contractive endomorphism $\phi$ of $S$; 2. fully inert if $x$ is $\phi$-inert for every contractive endomorphism $\phi$ of $S$; 3. uniformly fully inert if there exists $C>0$ such that $d(x,\phi(x))\leq C$ for every contractive endomorphism $\phi$ of $S$.
Definition 2.7.3. Fix $W\subset\mathcal{C}$. A localization of $\mathcal{C}$ along $W$ is any $\infty$-category $\mathcal{C}[W^{-1}]$ equipped with a functor $j:\mathcal{C}\to\mathcal{C}[W^{-1}]$ satisfying either (hence both) of the conditions of Lemma 2.7.2.
Definition 4.1.1. A chain complex is called acyclic if all its cohomology groups vanish. Fix an $A_{\infty}$-category $\mathcal{A}$. An object $Z$ of $\mathcal{A}$ is called a zero object if $\hom(Z,X)$ and $\hom(X,Z)$ are acyclic for any object $X\in\mathcal{A}$. We say that $\mathcal{A}$ is stable or pretriangulated if it has a zero object, and if its image under the Yoneda embedding $\mathcal{A}\to\mathcal{A}\mathsf{Mod}$ is closed under mapping cones and direct sums.
Definition 2.5.3. Let $\mathcal{C}$ be an $\infty$-category. An initial object of $\mathcal{C}$ is an object $X$ satisfying the following property: For any object $Y$, the space $\hom_{\mathcal{C}}(X,Y)$ is contractible. (See Definition 2.4.1.)
Definition 4.2.1 (Quotients). Fix an $A_{\infty}$-category $\mathcal{A}$. Let $\mathcal{B}\subset\mathcal{A}$ be a full subcategory, and let $0$ be a zero category. (For example, a category with a single object and only the 0 morphism.) Then the quotient $A_{\infty}$-category $\mathcal{A}/\mathcal{B}$ is defined to be the pushout $\xymatrix{\mathcal{B}\ar[r]\ar[d]&\mathcal{A}\ar[d]\\ 0\ar[r]&\mathcal{A}/\mathcal{B}}$ in $\mathcal{C}\!\operatorname{at}_{A_{\infty}}$.
Definition 2.6.1. Define $\mathcal{C}\!\operatorname{at}_{\infty}:=N(\mathsf{sSet}^{o}).$ In words, $\mathcal{C}\!\operatorname{at}_{\infty}$ is the simplicial set obtained by taking the simplicial nerve (Definition 2.1.6) of the enriched category of weak Kan complexes.
Definition 2.4.1. Fix an $\infty$-category $\mathcal{C}$ and two objects $x,y\in\mathcal{C}_{0}$. Define a simplicial set $\hom_{\mathcal{C}}(x,y)$ as follows. An $n$-simplex of $\hom_{\mathcal{C}}(x,y)$ is a map $f:\Delta^{0}\star\Delta^{n}\cong\Delta^{n+1}\to\mathcal{C}$ such that $f|_{\Delta^{0}}=x$ and $f|_{\Delta^{n}}$ is a constant map to $y$.
Definition 3.1.4. We let $\mathcal{C}\!\operatorname{at}_{A_{\infty}}:=N(A_{\infty}Cat)[N(W_{A_{\infty}}% )^{-1}],\qquad\mathcal{C}\!\operatorname{at}_{dg}:=N(dgCat)[N(W_{dg})^{-1}]$ be the localizations of $N(A_{\infty}Cat)$ and $N(dgCat)$ along the subcategory of equivalences (see Section 2.7). We refer to these as the $\infty$-category of $A_{\infty}$-categories, and of dg-categories, respectively.
Definition 4.3.4 ($\mathcal{L}_{W}$). Now consider the quotient $(\mathsf{Tw}\mathcal{A})/\mathcal{B}_{W}$, where $\mathcal{B}_{W}$ is as in Notation 4.3.3. The quotient receives a natural functor from $\mathcal{A}$, given by the composite $\mathcal{A}\to\mathsf{Tw}\mathcal{A}\to(\mathsf{Tw}\mathcal{A})/\mathcal{B}_{W}$. We let $\mathcal{L}_{W}\subset(\mathsf{Tw}\mathcal{A})/\mathcal{B}_{W}$ be the full subcategory consisting of objects in the essential image of $\mathcal{A}\to(\mathsf{Tw}\mathcal{A})/\mathcal{B}_{W}$.
Definition 2.6.4. Let $\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathcal{D}$ be $\infty$-categories. Define the simplicial set $\mathsf{Fun}(\mathcal{C},\mathcal{D})$ by $\mathsf{Fun}(\mathcal{C},\mathcal{D})_{n}:=\hom(\mathcal{C}\times\Delta^{n},% \mathcal{D}).$ There are obvious face and degeneracy maps induced by the $\Delta^{n}$ variable. We refer to this as the $\infty$-category of functors from $\mathcal{C}$ to $\mathcal{D}$. We call $\hom_{\mathcal{C}\!\operatorname{at}_{\infty}}(\mathcal{C},\mathcal{D})$ the space of functors from $\mathcal{C}$ to $\mathcal{D}$.
Definition 4.3.1. Let $\mathcal{A}$ be an $A_{\infty}$-category, and let $W\subset H^{0}\hom_{\mathcal{A}}$ be a collection of (cohomology classes of) morphisms in $\mathcal{A}$. A localization of $\mathcal{A}$ along $W$ is the data of an $A_{\infty}$-category $\mathcal{A}[W^{-1}]$, equipped with a functor $\iota:\mathcal{A}\to\mathcal{A}[W^{-1}]$ such that the following holds: For any $A_{\infty}$-category $\mathcal{D}$, the induced map of $\infty$-groupoids $\iota^{*}:\hom_{\mathcal{C}\!\operatorname{at}_{A_{\infty}}}(\mathcal{A}[W^{-1% }],\mathcal{D})\to\hom_{\mathcal{C}\!\operatorname{at}_{A_{\infty}}}(\mathcal{% A},\mathcal{D})$ is fully faithful, and identifies the essential image of $\iota^{*}$ with those functors $\mathcal{A}\to\mathcal{D}$ sending $W$ to (cohomologically) invertible morphisms in $\mathcal{D}$.
Definition 2.5.2. We call $\mathcal{C}_{I/}$ the slice $\infty$-category under $I$, or the comma $\infty$-category under $I$.
Definition 2.1.3. A simplicial set is a contravariant functor from $\Delta$ to the category of sets: $X:\Delta^{\operatorname{op}}\to\mathsf{Sets}.$ We will let $X_{n}$ denote the set assigned by $X$ to $[n]$. We call $X_{n}$ the set of $n$-simplices of $X$. A map of simplicial sets is a natural transformation.
Definition 2.2.1. An $\infty$-category, or quasi-category, or weak Kan complex, is a simplicial set $\mathcal{C}$ satisfying the following condition: For every $n\geq 2$ and $0<i<n$, and for every map $\Lambda^{n}_{i}\to\mathcal{C}$, there exists a map (indicated by a dashed arrow below) making the following diagram commute: $\xymatrix{\Lambda^{n}_{i}\ar[d]\ar[r]&\mathcal{C}\\ \Delta^{n}\ar@{-->}[ur]^{\exists}.}$ If the horn-fillers exist for $i=0$ and $i=n$ as well, we call $\mathcal{C}$ an $\infty$-groupoid, or a Kan complex. A functor is a map of simplicial sets. A natural transformation between functors $F_{0},F_{1}:\mathcal{C}\to\mathcal{D}$ is a map of simplicial sets $\mathcal{C}\times\Delta^{1}\to\mathcal{D}$ whose restrictions to $\mathcal{C}\times\{0\}$ and $\mathcal{C}\times\{1\}$ agree with $F_{0}$ and $F_{1}$, respectively.
Definition 2.5.4. Let $F:I\to\mathcal{C}$ be a functor. The colimit of $F$ is an initial object of $\mathcal{C}_{I/}$.
Definition 4.1.10. Let $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$ be stable. An $R$-linear functor $\mathcal{A}\to\mathcal{B}$ is called exact if it respects 0 objects, and if it sends mapping cone sequences to mapping cone sequences.
Definition 3.1.2. A functor between $A_{\infty}$- or dg-categories is called an equivalence if it is essentially surjective on objects, and if it induces a quasi-isomorphism on all morphism complexes. We let $W_{dg}\subset dgCat$ and $W_{A_{\infty}}\subset A_{\infty}Cat$ denote the subcategories consisting of equivalences.
Definition II.11. A Karoubi complete, additive, and $\mathds{C}$-linear monoidal $n$-category $\mathcal{A}$ has trivial centre when the map $\Sigma^{n}\mathds{C}\to\mathcal{Z}(\mathcal{A})$ picked out by the unit object is an equivalence.
Definition I.1. An $(n{+}1)$-dimensional topological order is a multifusion $n$-category with trivial centre.
Definition V.1. Let $h_{G}^{\bullet}$ be an equivariant cohomology theory. If $X$ is a $G$-space, then the group $\widetilde{h}_{G}^{\bullet}(X)$ of reduced equivariant cohomology classes on $X$ consist of pairs $(\alpha,\beta)$ where $\alpha\in h_{G}^{\bullet+1}(\mathrm{pt})$ and $\beta$ is trivialization of $\pi^{*}\alpha\in h_{G}^{\bullet+1}(X)$. I.e. in a cochain model, $\alpha$ is a degree-$(\bullet+1)$ cocycle, $\beta$ is a degree-$\bullet$ cochain which is not a cocycle but rather solves $\mathrm{d}\beta=\pi^{*}\alpha$, and $(\alpha,\beta)$ is cohomologous to $(\alpha+\mathrm{d}a,\beta+\pi^{*}a+\mathrm{d}b)$.
Definition II.3. Let $\mathcal{C}$ be an $n$-category with objects $X,Y\in\mathcal{C}$. A (categorical) condensation of $X$ onto $Y$, denoted $X\mathrel{\,\hskip 3.225pt\joinrel\rhook\joinrel\hskip-3.225pt\joinrel% \rightarrow}Y$, consists of morphisms $f:X\leftrightarrows Y:g$ together with a condensation $fg\mathrel{\,\hskip 3.225pt\joinrel\rhook\joinrel\hskip-3.225pt\joinrel% \rightarrow}\mathrm{id}_{Y}$. Note that the latter is a condensation in the $(n{-}1)$-category $\operatorname{End}_{\mathcal{C}}(Y)$, and so the definition compiles by induction. To begin the induction, equalities are declared to be examples of condensations.
Definition II.7. A monoidal $n$-category is multifusion if it is additive, $\mathds{C}$-linear, Karoubi-complete, and fully dualizable in $\mathbf{Mor}_{1}(\mathbf{KarCat}_{\mathds{C}})$.
Definition 1.4. Let $X$ be a simplicial set and let $T:\Delta/X\rightarrow{\mathscr{A}}$ be a Gabriel–Zisman natural system with values in a complete abelian category ${\mathscr{A}}$ with exact products. The Gabriel–Zisman cochain complex $C_{GZ}^{*}(X,T)$ of $X$ is defined as $C_{GZ}^{n}(X,T):=\prod_{\sigma_{n}\in X_{n}}T(\sigma_{n}),$ for each integer $n\geq 0$, with differential $d=\sum_{i=0}^{n+1}(-1)^{i}d^{i}:\prod_{\sigma_{n}\in X_{n}}T(\sigma_{n})% \longrightarrow\prod_{\sigma_{n+1}\in X_{n+1}}T(\sigma_{n+1}).$ The components of these $d^{i}$ are the morphisms $\delta^{i}_{\#}:T(\sigma_{n+1}\circ\delta^{i})\rightarrow T(\sigma_{n+1})$ induced by the coface maps $\delta^{i}:[n]\to[n+1]$. The $n$-th Gabriel–Zisman cohomology of $X$ is the cohomology of this cochain complex, $H^{n}_{GZ}(X,T)=H^{n}(C_{GZ}^{*}(X,T),d).$
Definition 1.8. Let ${\mathscr{C}}$ be a small category and ${\mathscr{A}}$ a cocomplete abelian category. Given two functors $P:{\mathscr{C}}\rightarrow\Delta$ and $T:{\mathscr{C}}^{op}\rightarrow{\mathscr{A}}$ the $n$-th homology of $P$ with coefficients in $T$ is defined as $H_{n}(P,T):=H_{n}(Lan^{P}(T)).$
Definition 2.5. Let $f:X\rightarrow Y$ be a map of simplicial sets and $T:\Delta/Y\rightarrow{\mathscr{A}}$ a (covariant) Gabriel-Zisman natural system. The map $f$ is called locally cohomologically constant if for each morphism $\theta:y\rightarrow y^{\prime}$ of the simplex category $\Delta/Y$ the induced map in cohomology $\theta^{*}:H^{q}_{GZ}(F_{y^{\prime}},T_{y^{\prime}})\stackrel{{\scriptstyle% \cong}}{{\to}}H^{q}_{GZ}(F_{y},T_{y})$ is an isomorphism.
Definition 1.2. Let ${\mathscr{C}}$ be a small category. The simplex category $\Delta/{\mathscr{C}}$ of ${\mathscr{C}}$ is the comma category whose objects are pairs $([m],f)$, where $[m]$ is an object of $\Delta$ and $f:[m]\to{\mathscr{C}}$ is a functor, and whose morphisms $([m],f)\longrightarrow([n],g)$ are morphisms $\theta:[m]\to[n]$ of $\Delta$ with $f=g\circ\theta$.
Definition 1.6. Let $X$ be a simplicial set and let $T:(\Delta/X)^{op}\rightarrow{\mathscr{A}}$ be a contravariant Gabriel–Zisman natural system with values in a cocomplete abelian category ${\mathscr{A}}$ with exact coproducts. The Gabriel–Zisman chain complex $C^{GZ}_{*}(X,T)$ of $X$ is defined as $C^{GZ}_{n}(X,T):=\bigoplus_{\sigma_{n}\in X_{n}}T(\sigma_{n}),$ for each integer $n\geq 0$, with differentials $\displaystyle d_{n}:\bigoplus_{\sigma_{n+1}\in X_{n+1}}\!\!\!\!T(\sigma_{n+1})$ $\displaystyle\longrightarrow$ $\displaystyle\bigoplus_{\sigma_{n}\in X_{n}}\!\!T(\sigma_{n})$ $\displaystyle a_{f}$ $\displaystyle\mapsto$ $\displaystyle\sum_{i=0}^{n+1}(-1)^{i}(\delta^{i})^{\#}(a_{f}),$ where $(\delta^{i})^{\#}:T(\sigma_{n+1})\to T(\sigma_{n+1}\circ\delta^{i})$ is induced by the coface map $\delta^{i}:[n]\to[n+1]$. The $n$-th Gabriel–Zisman homology of $X$ is defined as the homology of this chain complex, $H_{n}^{{GZ}}(X,T):=H_{n}(C^{{GZ}}_{*}(X,T),d).$
Definition 1.3. Let $X$ be a simplicial set and let ${\mathscr{M}}$ be a category. A functor $T:\Delta/X\rightarrow{\mathscr{M}}$ is called a (covariant) Gabriel–Zisman natural system on $X$ with values in ${\mathscr{M}}$.
Definition 1.1. Let $X$ be a simplicial set. The category of simplices or simplex category of $X$ is the comma category $\Delta/X$ whose objects are the simplices $x$ of $X$ and whose morphisms $x\to x^{\prime}$ are morphisms $\theta$ of $\Delta$ such that $x=X(\theta)(x^{\prime})$. Alternatively, the objects are pairs $([m],x)$, where $x:\Delta[m]\rightarrow X$, and morphisms are commuting triangles, $\xymatrix{\Delta[m]\ar[rr]^{\theta}\ar[rd]_{x}&&\Delta[m^{\prime}]\ar[ld]^{x^{% \prime}}\\ &X.}$ Given a map $f:X\to Y$ of simplicial sets there is a functor $\Delta/f:\Delta/X\to\Delta/Y$ given by $(\Delta/f)(x)=fx$.
Definition 2.13. Let $X$ be a simplicial set and ${\mathscr{M}}$ be a category. A (covariant) Gabriel-Zisman natural system $T:\Delta/X\rightarrow{\mathscr{M}}$ on $X$ is called invertible or a (covariant) local system if it sends all morphism of $\Delta/X$ to isomorphisms of ${\mathscr{M}}$. Dually, a (contravariant) Gabriel-Zisman natural system $T:(\Delta/X)^{op}\rightarrow{\mathscr{M}}$ on $X$ is called invertible or a (contravariant) local system if it sends all morphism of $(\Delta/X)^{op}$ to isomorphisms of ${\mathscr{M}}$.
Definition 1.7. Let ${\mathscr{C}}$ be a small category and ${\mathscr{A}}$ a complete abelian category. Given two functors $P:{\mathscr{C}}\rightarrow\Delta$ and $T:{\mathscr{C}}\rightarrow{\mathscr{A}}$ the $n$-th cohomology of $P$ with coefficients in $T$ is defined as $H^{n}(P,T):=H^{n}(Ran_{P}(T)).$
Definition 2.3. Given a map of simplicial sets $f:X\to Y$, the fiber functor $F_{(-)}:\Delta/Y\to\Delta^{\rm op}{\mathscr{S}}\hskip-2.27622ptet$ is defined as follows: For each object $y:\Delta[n]\to Y$ of the simplex category $\Delta/Y$, let $F_{y}$ be the fiber of $f$ over $y$, which is the simplicial set $F_{y}\;\;=\;\;\Delta[n]\times_{Y}X\;\;=\;\;\{(\sigma,x)\in\Delta[n]\times X:y% \circ\sigma=f(x)\},$ given by the pullback $\vbox{\xymatrix@R-1ex@C+2em{F_y\save*!/dr-1.2pc/dr:(-1,1)@^{|-}\restore\ar[r]^% {\bar{y}}\ar[d]&X\ar[d]^f\\ \Delta[n]\ar[r]_-y&Y.} }$ For each morphism from $y:\Delta[n]\to Y$ to $y^{\prime}:\Delta[n^{\prime}]\to Y$, given by $\theta:\Delta[n]\to\Delta[n^{\prime}]$ and satisfying $y=y^{\prime}\circ\theta$, let $F_{\theta}$ be the simplicial map given as: $\theta\times_{Y}X\;:\;F_{y}\to F_{y^{\prime}},\quad(\sigma,x)\mapsto(\theta% \circ\sigma,x).$
Definition 1.9. Let ${\mathscr{A}}\hskip-2.27622ptb$ the category of abelian groups, and ${\mathscr{A}}$ an additive category. Then (1) The category ${\mathscr{A}}$ is cotensored over ${\mathscr{A}}\hskip-2.27622ptb$ if there is a functor ${\rm Hom}:{\mathscr{A}}\hskip-2.27622ptb^{op}\times{\mathscr{A}}\to{\mathscr{A}}$, satisfying the natural exponential law ${\rm Hom}_{\mathscr{A}}(a,{\rm Hom}(A,b))\cong{\rm Hom}_{{\mathscr{A}}\hskip-2% .27622ptb}(A,{\rm Hom}_{\mathscr{A}}(a,b)).$ (2) The category ${\mathscr{A}}$ is tensored over ${\mathscr{A}}\hskip-2.27622ptb$ if there is a functor $\otimes:{\mathscr{A}}\hskip-2.27622ptb\times{\mathscr{A}}\to{\mathscr{A}}$ satisfying the natural exponential law ${\rm Hom}_{\mathscr{A}}(A\otimes a,b)\cong{\rm Hom}_{{\mathscr{A}}\hskip-2.276% 22ptb}(A,{\rm Hom}_{\mathscr{A}}(a,b)).$ Let $F:{\mathscr{C}}\to{\mathscr{A}}\hskip-2.27622ptb$, $T:{\mathscr{C}}\to{\mathscr{A}}$ be diagrams over ${\mathscr{C}}$. The symbolic hom $\overline{\rm Hom}_{{\mathscr{C}}}(F,T)$ as an object of ${\mathscr{A}}$ is determined by natural isomorphisms ${\rm Hom}_{\mathscr{A}}(a,\overline{\rm Hom}_{{\mathscr{C}}}(F,T))\cong{% \mathscr{N}}\hskip-3.698858ptat(F,{\rm Hom}_{\mathscr{A}}(a,T(-))).$ Dually, for diagrams $F:{\mathscr{C}}\to{\mathscr{A}}\hskip-2.27622ptb$, $T:{\mathscr{C}}^{op}\to{\mathscr{A}}$, the symbolic tensor product $F\underline{\otimes}_{{\mathscr{C}}}T$ as an object of ${\mathscr{A}}$ is determined by natural isomorphisms ${\rm Hom}_{\mathscr{A}}(F\underline{\otimes}_{{\mathscr{C}}}T,b)\cong{\mathscr% {N}}\hskip-3.698858ptat(F,{\rm Hom}_{\mathscr{A}}(T(-),b)).$
Definition 1.5. Let $X$ be a simplicial set and let ${\mathscr{M}}$ be a category. A functor $T:(\Delta/X)^{op}\rightarrow{\mathscr{M}}$ is called a (contravariant) Gabriel–Zisman natural system with values in ${\mathscr{M}}$.
Definition 2.6. Let $f:X\rightarrow Y$ be a map of simplicial sets and $T:\Delta/Y\rightarrow{\mathscr{A}}$ a (covariant) Gabriel-Zisman natural system. The map $f$ is called locally cohomologically trivial if for every simplex $y:\Delta[n]\rightarrow Y$ of $Y$ the induced map in cohomology $H_{GZ}^{*}(\Delta[n],T_{\Delta[n]})\stackrel{{\scriptstyle\cong}}{{\rightarrow% }}H^{*}_{GZ}(F_{y},(f^{*}T)_{y})$ is an isomorphism.
Definition 3.16. Let $U_{1}=(\mathcal{H}_{1},(U_{1}^{(t)})_{t},E_{1})$, $U_{2}=(\mathcal{H}_{2},(U_{2}^{(t)})_{t},E_{2})$ be two discrete-time or continuous-time $d$-dimensional quantum walks. If there exists a smooth invertible intertwiner $T\colon\mathcal{H}_{1}\to\mathcal{H}_{2}$ between $U_{1}$ and $U_{2}$ (or equivalently, a smooth isomorphism between two objectis $U_{1}$ and $U_{2}$), then we say that these two quantum walks are similar.
Definition 7.1. An analytic function $\lambda\colon\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{T}$ is called an eigenvalue function of $\widehat{U}=\left(L^{2}(\mathbb{T}_{2\pi})\otimes\mathbb{C}^{n},\left(\widehat% {U}^{t}\right)_{t\in\mathbb{Z}},\widehat{E}\right)$ (or an eigenvalue function of $U$), if for every $k\in\mathbb{R}$, $\lambda(k)$ is an eigenvalue of $\widehat{U}(k)$.
Definition 3.2. A triple $(\mathcal{H},(U^{(t)})_{t\in\mathbb{R}},E)$ is called a $d$-dimensional continuous-time quantum walk, if $(\mathcal{H},E)$ is a Hilbert space with a $d$-dimensional coordinate system and $(U^{(t)})_{t\in\mathbb{R}}$ is a unitary representation of $\mathbb{R}$ on $\mathcal{H}$ which is continuous with respect to the strong operator topology.
Definition 2.13. A triple $(\mathcal{H},E,(\rho(\mathbf{x}))_{\mathbf{x}\in\mathbb{Z}^{d}})$ is called a Hilbert space with a right regular representation of $\mathbb{Z}^{d}$, if $(\mathcal{H},E)$ is a Hilbert space with a $d$-dimensional coordinate system and $\rho$ is a unitary representation of $\mathbb{Z}^{d}$ on $\mathcal{H}$ and if the following condition holds: for every Borel subset $A\subset\mathbb{R}^{d}$ and for every $\mathbf{x}\in\mathbb{Z}^{d}$, $\rho(\mathbf{x})E(A)\rho(-\mathbf{x})=E(A-\mathbf{x})$.
Definition 5.2. Let $j$ be $1$ or $2$. Let $U_{j}=\left(\mathcal{H}_{j},\left(U_{j}^{(t)}\right)_{t},E_{j},(\rho_{j}(% \mathbf{x}))_{\mathbf{x}\in\mathbb{Z}^{d}}\right)$ be two $d$-dimensional homogeneous quantum walks. Let $T\colon\mathcal{H}_{1}\to\mathcal{H}_{2}$ be a bounded linear operator. The operator $T$ is said to be a homogeneous intertwiner or a homogeneous morphism in the category of $d$-dimensional homogeneous quantum walks, if • for every $t$, $TU_{1}^{(t)}=U_{2}^{(t)}T$, • for every $\mathbf{x}\in\mathbb{Z}^{d}$, $T\rho_{1}(\mathbf{x})=\rho_{2}(\mathbf{x})T$. Define the four kinds of regularity of $T$, using $E_{1}$ and $E_{2}$ as in Definition 2.8.
Definition 8.7. If a walk $(\mathcal{H},(U^{t})_{t\in\mathbb{Z}},E)$ is similar to a non-trivial direct sum of two quantum walks, $U$ is said to be decomposable. Otherwise, it is said to be indecomposable.
Definition 3.13. Let $(\mathcal{H}_{1},(U_{1}^{t})_{t\in\mathbb{Z}},E_{1})$ and $(\mathcal{H}_{2},(U_{2}^{t})_{t\in\mathbb{Z}},E_{2})$ be $d$-dimensional discrete-time quantum walks. Let $T$ be a bounded linear operator from $\mathcal{H}_{1}$ to $\mathcal{H}_{2}$. The operator $T$ is called an intertwiner (or a morphism) from $(\mathcal{H}_{1},(U_{1}^{t})_{t\in\mathbb{Z}},E_{1})$ to $(\mathcal{H}_{2},(U_{2}^{t})_{t\in\mathbb{Z}},E_{2})$, if $TU_{1}=U_{2}T$ holds.
Definition 2.8. Let $W$ be a morphism from $(\mathcal{H}_{1},E_{1})$ to $(\mathcal{H}_{2},E_{2})$. Let $v_{j}=v_{E_{j}}$ be the unitary representation of $\mathbb{R}^{d}=\widehat{\mathbb{R}}^{d}$ associated to $(\mathcal{H}_{j},E_{j})$. For every $\mathbf{k}\in\mathbb{R}^{d}$, define $W_{\mathbf{k}}\in\mathcal{B}(\mathcal{H}_{2}\leftarrow\mathcal{H}_{1})$ by $W_{\mathbf{k}}=v_{2}(\mathbf{k})\cdot W\cdot v_{1}(-\mathbf{k}).$ We define four kinds of regularity as follows: (1) The operator $W$ is called a morphism with finite propagation, if the following condition holds: there exists a constant $R=R_{W}$ such that for every Borel subset $A_{1},A_{2}$ of $\mathbb{R}^{d}$, if $\mathrm{dist}(A_{1},A_{2})>R$, then $E_{2}(A_{2})WE_{1}(A_{1})=0$. (2) The operator $W$ is called an analytic morphism, if the following condition holds: there exists a holomorphic map from a domain in $\mathbb{C}^{d}$ including $\mathbb{R}^{d}$ to $\mathcal{B}(\mathcal{H})$ which extends the mapping $\mathbb{R}^{d}\ni\mathbf{k}\mapsto W_{\mathbf{k}}\in\mathcal{B}(\mathcal{H}_{2% }\leftarrow\mathcal{H}_{1}).$ (3) The operator $W$ is called a smooth morphism, if the mapping $\mathbb{R}^{d}\ni\mathbf{k}\mapsto W_{\mathbf{k}}\in\mathcal{B}(\mathcal{H}_{2% }\leftarrow\mathcal{H}_{1})$ is smooth. (4) The operator $W$ is called a uniform morphism, if the mapping $\mathbb{R}^{d}\ni\mathbf{k}\mapsto W_{\mathbf{k}}\in\mathcal{B}(\mathcal{H}_{2% }\leftarrow\mathcal{H}_{1})$ is continuous with respect to the operator norm.
Definition 3.15. Let $T$ be an intertwiner (or a morphism) from $(\mathcal{H}_{1},(U_{1}^{t})_{t\in\mathbb{Z}},E_{1})$ to $(\mathcal{H}_{2},(U_{2}^{t})_{t\in\mathbb{Z}},E_{2})$. (1) The intertwining operator $T$ is said to have finite propagation, if $T$ has finite propagation as a morphism from $(\mathcal{H}_{1},E_{1})$ to $(\mathcal{H}_{2},E_{2})$. (2) The intertwining operator $T$ is said to be analytic (smooth, or uniform), if $T$ is analytic (smooth, or uniform, respectively) morphism from $(\mathcal{H}_{1},E_{1})$ to $(\mathcal{H}_{2},E_{2})$.
Definition 2.7. Let $(\mathcal{H}_{1},E_{1})$ and $(\mathcal{H}_{2},E_{2})$ be Hilbert spaces with $d$-dimensional coordinate systems. A bounded linear operator $W$ from $\mathcal{H}_{1}$ to $\mathcal{H}_{2}$ is called a morphism from the object $(\mathcal{H}_{1},E_{1})$ to the object $(\mathcal{H}_{2},E_{2})$
Definition 3.1. A triple $(\mathcal{H},(U^{t})_{t\in\mathbb{Z}},E)$ is called a $d$-dimensional quantum walk, if $(\mathcal{H},E)$ is a Hilbert space with a $d$-dimensional coordinate system and $(U^{t})_{t\in\mathbb{Z}}$ is a unitary representation of $\mathbb{Z}$ on $\mathcal{H}$.
Definition 2.5. Let $(\mathcal{H},E)$ be a Hilbert space with a $d$-dimensional coordinate system. Let $\xi$ be a vector in $\mathcal{H}$. (1) It is said that the support of $\xi$ is compact, if there exists a compact subset $\Omega$ of $\mathbb{R}^{d}$ such that $\xi\in E(\Omega)\mathcal{H}$. (2) The vector $\xi$ is said to be analytic, if the mapping $\mathbb{R}^{d}\ni\mathbf{k}\mapsto v_{E}(\mathbf{k})\xi\in\mathcal{H}$ can be extended to a holomorphic map defined in a domain in $\mathbb{C}^{d}$. (3) The vector $\xi$ is said to be smooth, if the mapping $\mathbb{R}^{d}\ni\mathbf{k}\mapsto v_{E}(\mathbf{k})\xi\in\mathcal{H}$ is smooth. (4) The vector $\xi$ is said to be uniform, if the mapping $\mathbb{R}^{d}\ni\mathbf{k}\mapsto v_{E}(\mathbf{k})\xi\in\mathcal{H}$ is continuous.
Definition 2.1. Let $\mathcal{H}$ be a complex Hilbert space, and let $d$ be a natural number. Let $E$ is a map which maps every Borel subset of $\mathbb{R}^{d}$ to an orthogonal projection in $\mathcal{B}(\mathcal{H})$. A pair $(\mathcal{H},E)$ is called a Hilbert space with a $d$-dimensional coordinate system, if $E$ is countably additive and $E(\mathbb{R}^{d})$ is the identity operator on $\mathcal{H}$. The map $E$ is called a spectral measure on $\mathbb{R}^{d}$ or a coordinate system of $\mathcal{H}$.
Definition 5.1. Let $t$ be an element of the group of time $\mathbb{Z}$ or $\mathbb{R}$. The quadruple $U=(\mathcal{H}$, $(U^{(t)})_{t}$, $E$, $(\rho(\mathbf{x}))_{\mathbf{x}\in\mathbb{Z}^{d}})$ is called a $d$-dimensional homogeneous quantum walk, if it satisfies the following conditions: (1) The triplet $(\mathcal{H},(U^{(t)})_{t},E)$ is a $d$-dimensional quantum walk, (2) The unitary representation $\rho$ is an action of $\mathbb{Z}^{d}$ on $\mathcal{H}$, (3) For every Borel subset $\Omega$ of $\mathbb{R}^{d}$, and every $\mathbf{x}\in\mathbb{Z}^{d}$, $\rho(\mathbf{x})^{-1}E(\Omega)\rho(\mathbf{x})=E(\Omega+\mathbf{x}),$ (4) For every $t$, and for every $\mathbf{x}\in\mathbb{Z}^{d}$, $U^{(t)}\rho(\mathbf{x})=\rho(\mathbf{x})U^{(t)}$, (5) The dimension of the image of the orthogonal projection $E([0,1)^{d})$ is finite. The dimension at the last item is called the degree of freedom of $U$. Define the four kinds of regularity (having finite propagation, analyticity, smoothness, uniformity) of $U$ by those of the triple $(\mathcal{H},(U^{(t)})_{t},E)$. In the case that $(U^{(t)})_{t}$ is a representation of $\mathbb{Z}$, we call the quadruple a discrete-time homogeneous quantum walk or simply a homogeneous quantum walk. In the case that $(U^{(t)})_{t}$ is a strongly continuous representation of $\mathbb{R}$, we call the quadruple a continuous-time homogeneous quantum walk.
Definition 7.6. Define a model quantum walk $\widehat{U}_{\lambda,p}$ by the triple $\left(L^{2}(\mathbb{T}_{p}),(M[\lambda]^{t})_{t\in\mathbb{Z}},\frac{1}{\mathbf% {i}}\frac{d}{dk}\right)$.
