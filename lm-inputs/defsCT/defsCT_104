Definition 33 Let $\Phi:(X,S)\rightarrow(Y,T)$ be a measurable function between Borel spaces. Let $\mu_{y}(x)$ be a $\Phi$-fibered measure on $X$. For a(n almost) measurable field of Hilbert spaces $\cal H$ on $(X,S)$, let $\int^{\oplus}_{\Phi}{\cal H}_{x}d\mu_{y}(x)$ denote the (almost) measurable field of Hilbert spaces with fiber at $y$ given by $\int^{\oplus}_{X}{\cal H}_{x}d\mu_{y}(x)$, and measurable sections given by the closure under condition 2 of the image of the set of measurable sections of $\cal H$.
Definition 10 A measurable field of Hilbert spaces $\cal H$ on $(X,S)$ is a partial measurable line bundle if for all $x\in X$ either ${\cal H}_{x}\cong{{C}}$ or ${\cal H}_{x}\cong 0$.
Definition 26 Given a(n almost) measurable field $\cal H$ of Hilbert spaces on a Borel space $(X,S)$ and a measure $\mu$ on $(X,S)$, the direct integral $\int^{\oplus}_{X}{\cal H}_{x}d\mu(x)$ is the Hilbert space of all measurable sections $\xi\in{\cal M}_{\cal H}$ such that $\|\xi\|=\{\int_{x}\|\xi(x)\|^{2}d\mu(x)\}^{\frac{1}{2}}<+\infty\;\;\;(*)$ modulo the identification of measurable sections which are equal $\mu$-a.e. and equipped with the scalar product $\langle\xi|\zeta\rangle=\int\langle\xi(x)|\zeta(x)\rangle d\mu(x)$ We call a section $\xi$ satisfying $(*)$ an $L^{2}$ section of $\cal H$, and denote its $\mu$-a.e. equivalence class by $\int^{\oplus}_{X}\xi(x)d\mu(x)$. Similarly given a ($\mu$-essentially) bounded field of operators $\alpha:{\cal H}\rightarrow{\cal K}$, the direct integral $\int^{\oplus}_{X}\alpha(x)d\mu(x)$ is the map which takes an element $\xi$ of $\int^{\oplus}_{X}{\cal H}_{x}d\mu(x)$ to the element of $\int^{\oplus}_{X}{\cal K}_{x}d\mu(x)$ given at each point $x$ by $\alpha(x)(\xi(x))$. For a ($\mu$-essentially) bounded field of operators $\alpha(x)$, we denote the map taking $\int^{\oplus}_{X}\xi(x)d\mu(x)$ to the a.e.-equality class of the section $x\mapsto\alpha(x)(\xi(x))$ by $\int^{\oplus}_{X}\alpha(x)d\mu(x)$.
Definition 54 A measurable category over $X$ is a monoidal category $\cal C$ equipped with monoidal functors $U:{\cal C}\rightarrow{\bf Meas}(X)$ and $T:{\bf Meas}(X)\rightarrow{\cal C}$ such that there is a natural isomorphism $U(T)\cong Id_{{\bf Meas}(X)}$. Objects of $\cal C$ isomorphic to object of the form $T({\cal H})$ are called trivial objects.
Definition 16 An invertible additive functor is a functor $F$ between two additive categories, which admits an inverse functor (up to natural isomorphism) $G$ such that both $F$ and $G$ preserve the addition of parallel maps, the zero object (up to canonical isomorphism) and the biproducts (up to canonical isomorphism).
Definition 48 A measurable natural transformation between two measurable functors $\Phi_{{\cal F},\mu_{y}},\Phi_{{\cal G},\nu_{y}}:{\bf Meas}(X,S)\rightarrow{\bf Meas% }(Y,T)$ is a natural transformation with component at $\cal H$ given by $\zeta_{y}\mapsto\int^{\oplus}\sqrt{\frac{d\tilde{\mu}_{y}}{d\nu_{y}}}Id_{{\cal H% }_{x}}\otimes B_{(x,y)}(\zeta_{x,y})d\nu_{y}(x)$ where $\zeta_{y}=\int^{\oplus}\zeta_{x,y}d\mu_{y}(x)$, for some field of operators $B:{\cal F}\rightarrow{\cal G}$ which is $\nu_{y}$-essentially bounded for all $y$.
Definition 1 A measurable field of Hilbert spaces ${\cal H}$ on a Borel space $(X,S)$ is a pair $({\cal H}_{x},{\cal M}_{\cal H})$, where ${\cal H}_{x}$ is an X-indexed family of Hilbert spaces, and ${\cal M}_{\cal H}={\cal M}$ is a linear subspace of $\prod_{x\in X}{\cal H}_{x}$ (the product as vector-spaces) satisfying 1. $\forall\xi\in{\cal M}\;x\mapsto\|\xi(x)\|_{x}$ is measurable, 2. For all $\eta\in\prod_{x\in X}{\cal H}_{x}$ the measurability of $x\mapsto\langle\eta(x)|\xi(x)\rangle_{x}$ for all $\xi\in{\cal M}$ implies $\eta\in{\cal M}$, 3. $\exists\{\xi_{i}\}_{i=1}^{\infty}\subset{\cal M}$ such that $\{\xi_{i}(x)\}_{i=1}^{\infty}$ is dense in ${\cal H}_{x}$ for all $x\in X$. An almost measurable field of Hilbert spaces ${\cal H}$ on a Borel space $(X,S)$ is a pair $({\cal H}_{x},{\cal M}_{\cal H})$ as above, satisfying conditions 1 and 2, but not necessarily condition 3.
Definition 39 A functor from ${\bf Meas}(X,S)$ to ${\bf Meas}(Y,T)$ is measurable if it is ${{C}}$-linear equivalent to one of the form $\Phi_{{\cal K},\mu_{y}}$.
Definition 2 A measurable field of bounded operators $\phi$ from ${\cal H}$ to ${\cal K}$, for ${\cal H}$ and ${\cal K}$ (almost) measurable fields of Hilbert spaces is an X-indexed family of bounded operators $\phi_{x}\in B({\cal H}_{x},{\cal K}_{x})$ such that $\xi\in{\cal M}_{\cal H}$ implies $\phi(\xi)\in{\cal M}_{\cal K}$, where $\phi(\xi)_{x}=\phi_{x}(\xi_{x})$. A measurable field of bounded operators is bounded if the real valued function $x\mapsto\|\phi_{x}\|_{x}$ is bounded. A measurable field of bounded operators is essentially bounded with respect to a measure $\mu$ on $(X,S)$ if $x\mapsto\|\phi_{x}\|_{x}$ is in $L^{\infty}(X,\mu)$. (Here $\|\;\|_{x}$ denotes the operator norm on $B({\cal H}_{x},{\cal K}_{x})$.)
Definition 52 Given a measurable field $\cal K$ of ${\bf Meas}(X)$-objects on $Y$, and a measure $\nu$ on $Y$, the direct integral $\int^{\oplus}{\cal K}_{<x,y>}d\nu(y)$ is the image of the total measurable line bundle ${C}$ on $Y$ under the measurable functor $\Phi_{{\cal K},\nu}$, where $\nu$ is interpreted as the $p_{1}$ fibered measure for which $\nu_{x}(A)=\nu(p_{2}(A\cap p_{1}^{-1}(x)).$
Definition 3 The category of measurable fields of Hilbert spaces on $(X,S)$ has as objects all measurable fields of Hilbert spaces on $(X,S)$ and as arrows all bounded fields of operators on $X$. Source, target, identity arrow and composition are obvious. We denote this category by ${\bf Meas}(X,S)$. Similarly, the category of almost measurable fields of Hilbert spaces on $(X,S)$ has as objects all almost measurable fields of Hilbert spaces on $(X,S)$ and as arrows all bounded fields of bounded operator between them. We denote this category by ${\bf AlMeas}(X,S)$.
Definition 7 If $\cal H$ (resp. $\xi$, $B$) is a(n almost) measurable field of Hilbert spaces (resp. a measurable section, a measurable field of operators) on $(X,S)$, and $A\in S$, then the restriction of $\cal H$ (resp. $\xi$, $B$) to $A$, denoted ${\cal H}|_{A}$ (resp. $\xi|_{A}$, $B|_{A}$), is given by ${\cal H}|_{Ax}=\left\{\begin{array}[]{ll}{\cal H}_{x}&\mbox{if $x\in A$}\\ 0&\mbox{otherwise}\end{array}\right.$ with ${\cal M}_{{\cal H}|_{A}}={\cal M}_{\cal H}\cap\prod_{x}{\cal H}|_{Ax}$, where we identify ${\cal H}|_{Ax}$ with a subspace of ${\cal H}_{x}$, either the entire Hilbert space or 0 (resp. $\xi|_{A}(x)=\left\{\begin{array}[]{ll}\xi(x)&\mbox{if $x\in A$}\\ 0&\mbox{otherwise}\end{array}\right.,$ $B_{A}(x)=\left\{\begin{array}[]{ll}B(x)&\mbox{if $x\in A$}\\ 0&\mbox{otherwise ).}\end{array}\right.$
Definition 30 For a measurable function $\Phi:(X,S)\rightarrow(Y,T)$ between Borel spaces, a $\Phi$-fibered measure on $X$ is a uniformly totally $\sigma$-finite conditional measure distribution $\mu_{y}$, that is a $Y$-indexed family of measures on $X$ such that 1. $\mu_{y}(X\setminus\Phi^{-1}(y))=0$ 2. For all $A\in S$ the function $y\mapsto\mu_{y}(A)$ is measurable 3. There exist a sequence of measurable sets $A_{n}$ such that $X=\cup_{n}A_{a}$ and for all $y\in Y$ and all $n$ $\mu_{y}(A_{n})<\infty$
Definition 57 A measurable bicategory $\cal C$ is a monoidal bicategory $\cal C$ equipped with monoidal bifunctors $U:{\cal C}\rightarrow{\bf Meas}$ and $T:{\bf Meas}\rightarrow{\cal C}$ such that $U(T)$ is naturally isomorphic to $Id_{\bf Meas}$
Definition 17 A functor $F:{\cal C}\rightarrow{\cal D}$ between $C^{*}$-categories is bounded if there exists a constant $N>0$ such that for all $f:X\rightarrow Y\in Arr({\cal C})$ $\|F(f)\|\leq N\|f\|.$
Definition 6 The support of (an almost) measurable field of Hilbert spaces $\cal H$ on a Borel space $(X,S)$ is the set $supp({\cal H})=\{x\in X|{\cal H}_{x}\not\cong 0\}$. The support of a measurable section $\xi\in{\cal M}_{\cal H}$ is the set $supp(\xi)=\{x\in X|\xi(x)\neq 0\}$. Note by taking norms that it is necessarily a measurable set. The support of a field of bounded operators $B$ is the set $supp(B)=\{x\in X|B(x)\neq 0\}$.
Definition 2.1 ( P -flatness) Given a family ${\cal P}$ of indexes, a presheaf $F:A^{op}\rightarrow{\cal V}$ is said ${\cal P}$-flat when its left Kan extension along $Y$, $-*F:[A,{\cal V}]\rightarrow{\cal V}$ preserves all ${\cal P}$-limits. $Flat_{\cal P}$ will denote the family of all ${\cal P}$-flat presheaves, and for any ${\cal V}$-category $A$, $Flat_{\cal P}(A)$ will denote the full subcategory of $[A^{op},{\cal V}]$ with objects ${\cal P}$-flat presheaves.
Definition 2. Let $(T,G,\mu)$ and $(A,B,\delta)$ be crossed modules, and let $\mathcal{G}_{(T,G,\mu)}$, $\mathcal{G}_{(A,B,\delta)}$ be the corresponding cat${}^{1}$-groups. We say that $(A,B,\delta)$ is a $(T,G,\mu)$-module if $\mathcal{G}_{(A,B,\delta)}$is a $\mathcal{G}_{(T,G,\mu)}$-module in the sense of categories of interest.
Definition 4. Let $(A,B,\delta)$, $(A^{\prime},B^{\prime},\delta^{\prime})$ be $(T,G,\mu)$-modules. A morphism $f:(A,B,\delta)\rightarrow(A^{\prime},B^{\prime},\delta^{\prime})$ of $(T,G,\mu)$-modules is a crossed module morphism such that the corresponding morphism of cat${}^{1}$-groups $f:\mathcal{G}_{(A,B,\delta)}\rightarrow\mathcal{G}_{(A^{\prime},B^{\prime},% \delta^{\prime})}$ is a morphism of $\mathcal{G}_{(A,B,\delta)}$-modules in the sense of categories of interest.
Definition 1 Let $z\sim_{2}x$. We say that $z$ is a Laplacian neighbour of $x$ (written $z\sim_{L}x$) if for every proper tangent $t$ at $x$, we have $g(x,z)=n\cdot g(x,proj_{t}(z)),$ where $n$ is the dimension of the manifold.
Definition 33 A homomorphism $H:A\rightarrow B$ between classical bicategories is called proper if the associated coherence data has the following properties: 1. for all 1-cells $f,g$ of $A$ $Hf\bigcirc_{0}^{1}Hg=H(f\bigcirc_{0}^{1}g)\Longrightarrow\phi_{f,g}=id_{2}^{1}% (H(f\bigcirc_{0}^{1}g))$ 2. for all 0-cells $a$ of $A$ $id_{1}^{0}(Ha)=H(id_{1}^{0}a)\Longrightarrow\phi_{a}=id_{2}^{1}(H(id_{1}^{0}a))$ 3. for all 1-cells $f,f^{\prime},g,g^{\prime}$ of $A$ $f\bigcirc_{0}^{1}g=f^{\prime}\bigcirc_{0}^{1}g^{\prime}\text{ and \ }Hf% \bigcirc_{0}^{1}Hg=Hf^{\prime}\bigcirc_{0}^{1}Hg^{\prime}\Longrightarrow\phi_{% f,g}=\phi_{f^{\prime},g^{\prime}}$ 4. for all 0-cells $a,b$ of $A$ $\ $ $Ha=Hb\text{ and }H(id_{1}^{0}a)=H(id_{1}^{0}a)\Longrightarrow\phi_{a}=\phi_{b}$
