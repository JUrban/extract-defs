Definition 30 Assume a Q-category. An object $A$ can be cloned iff there is an object $W$, an arrow $c:A\otimes W\rightarrow(A\otimes A)\otimes W$ and a preparation $w:$ $I\rightarrow W$ such that for any normalized preparation $a:I\rightarrow A$ there is a preparation $w_{a}:I\rightarrow W$, ${w}_{a}\neq 0$ such that $c\circ(a\otimes w)=$ $(a\otimes a)\otimes w_{a}$.
Definition 4 Let $f:A\rightarrow A$, $x:B\rightarrow A$ and $s:B\rightarrow B$. We shall say that $x$ is an eigenvector for $f$, with eigenvalue $s$ iff $x$ is right-unitary and we have $f\circ x=$ $x\circ s$.
Definition 10 Assume $I$ is a unit object in an A-category ${\cal C}$ and let $A,B,C$ be objects of ${\cal C}$. A bi-arrow of sort $A,B\rightarrow C$ is a function $\alpha:$ $Hom(I,A)\times Hom(I,B)$ $\>\rightarrow\>$ $Hom(I,C)$ such that: • for any arrow $a:$ $I\rightarrow A$ there is an arrow $\alpha^{1}(a):$ $B\rightarrow C$, • for any arrow $b:$ $I\rightarrow B$ there is an arrow $\alpha^{2}(b):$ $A\rightarrow C$, such that • for any $a:$ $I\rightarrow A$ and any $b:$ $I\rightarrow B$ one has: $\alpha(a,b)\ =\ \alpha^{2}(b)\circ a\ =\ \alpha^{1}(a)\circ b.$
Definition 24 A category that is both a T-category and a B-category will be called a BT-category.
Definition 1 An $A-category$ is a category in which every arrow $f:A\rightarrow B$ is associated with an adjoint arrow $f^{\star}:B\rightarrow A$, such that for any such $f$ and any $g:B\rightarrow C$ one has: ${(f^{\star})}^{\star}\ =\ f\ ,\ {(g\circ f)}^{\star}\ =\ {f}^{\star}\circ{g}^{% \star}.$
Definition 17 An Az-category is said to be a B-category iff every pair of objects admits a u-coproduct.
Definition 5 An arrow of sort $I\rightarrow A$ is called a preparation. An arrow of sort $A\rightarrow I$ is called a destruction. An arrow of sort $I\rightarrow I$ is both a preparation and a destruction and is called a scalar.
Definition 11 We assume an A-category with unit object $I$. A bi-arrow $\kappa:A,B\rightarrow X$ is said to be a tensor product (for $A$ and $B$) iff: 1. for any object $Y$ and any bi-arrow $\alpha:A,B\rightarrow Y$ there is a unique arrow $x:X\rightarrow Y$ such that $\alpha=$ $x\circ\kappa$, and 2. for any preparations $a,a^{\prime}:I\rightarrow A$ and $b,b^{\prime}:I\rightarrow B$ one has $\kappa^{\star}(a,b)\circ\kappa(a^{\prime},b^{\prime})\ =\ {a}^{\star}\circ a^{% \prime}\circ{b}^{\star}\circ b^{\prime}.$ In such a case we shall write $A\otimes B$ for $X$.
Definition 28 Assume ${\cal C}$ is a Q-category and let $A,X$ be objects of ${\cal C}$. A bi-arrow $\alpha:A,A\rightarrow X$ is said to be symmetric (resp. anti-symmetric) iff, for any preparations $a,b:I\rightarrow A$ one has: $\alpha(a,b)=$ $\alpha(b,a)$ (resp. $\alpha(a,b)=$ ${\alpha(b,a)}^{-}$).
Definition 14 A family of arrows ${0}_{A,B}:A\rightarrow B$, for each pair of objects $A$, $B$, is said to be a z-family iff for any objects $A$, $A^{\prime}$, $B^{\prime}$ and $B$ and any arrows $f:A\rightarrow A^{\prime}$ and $g:B^{\prime}\rightarrow B$ one has: $g\circ{0}_{A^{\prime},B^{\prime}}\circ f=$ ${0}_{A,B}$. Any category that admits a z-family will be called a z-category. An A-category that is a z-category is called an Az-category. A T-category that is a z-category is a Tz-category.
Definition 8 Assume an A-category and a unit object $I$. For any object $A$ and any preparations $a,b:I\rightarrow A$ we define their scalar product $\langle b\mid a\rangle$ to be the scalar ${b}^{\star}\circ a$. The sqnorm of $a$, $sq(a)$ is defined to be the scalar product of $a$ with itself: ${a}^{\star}\circ a$.
Definition 21 In a B-category with unit object, a basis for an object $A$ is a set $\{a_{i}\mid i\in J\}$ of normalized, pairwise orthogonal preparations $a_{i}:I\rightarrow A$ such that for any $b:I\rightarrow A$, if $b$ is orthogonal to every $a_{i},i\in J$, then $b=$ ${0}_{I,A}$.
Definition 29 We assume a Q-category. A symmetric (resp. anti-symmetric) bi-arrow $\sigma:A,A\rightarrow X$ is said to be an s-tensor (resp. an a-tensor) product (for $A$) iff: 1. for any object $Y$ and any symmetric (resp. ant-symmetric) bi-arrow $\alpha:A,A\rightarrow Y$ there is a unique arrow $x:X\rightarrow Y$ such that $\alpha=$ $x\circ\sigma$, and 2. for any preparations $a,b,a^{\prime},b^{\prime}:I\rightarrow A$ one has $\sigma^{\star}(a,b)\circ\sigma(a^{\prime},b^{\prime})\circ 2\ =\ {a}^{\star}% \circ a^{\prime}\circ{b}^{\star}\circ b^{\prime}+{a}^{\star}\circ b^{\prime}% \circ{b}^{\star}\circ a$ $(resp.\ \ \sigma^{\star}(a,b)\circ\sigma(a^{\prime},b^{\prime})\circ 2\ =\ {a}% ^{\star}\circ a^{\prime}\circ{b}^{\star}\circ b^{\prime}+{({a}^{\star}\circ b^% {\prime}\circ{b}^{\star}\circ a)}^{-}).$ In such a case we shall write $A{\otimes}_{s}A$ (resp. $A{\otimes}_{a}A$) for $X$.
Definition 19 Let $A$ be an object of a B-category. Let $u:A\rightarrow A\oplus A$ and $v:A\rightarrow A\oplus A$ be a coproduct. The diagonal $\Delta_{A}$ of $A$ is the arrow $A\rightarrow A\oplus A$ defined by: $\Delta_{A}=$ $\left({id}_{A}\ {id}_{A}\right)$, i.e., the unique arrow such that ${u}^{\star}\circ\Delta_{A}=$ ${id}_{A}$ and ${v}^{\star}\circ\Delta_{A}=$ ${id}_{A}$. The codiagonal $\nabla_{A}$ of $A$ is the arrow $A\oplus A\rightarrow A$ defined by: $\nabla_{A}=$ $[{id}_{A}\ {id}_{A}]$, i.e., the unique arrow such that $\nabla_{A}\circ u=$ ${id}_{A}$ and $\nabla_{A}\circ v=$ ${id}_{A}$.
Definition 13 Let $f:$ $A^{\prime}\rightarrow A$ and $g:$ $B^{\prime}\rightarrow B$ be arrows in a T-category. Their tensor product $f\otimes g:$ $A^{\prime}\otimes B^{\prime}\rightarrow A\otimes B$ is defined as the unique arrow such that $(f\otimes g)\circ\kappa_{A^{\prime},B^{\prime}}=$ $\kappa_{A,B}\circ(f,g)$.
Definition 26 A normalizable BT-category is said to be an Q-category iff 1. every scalar $s$ that is different from $0$ is invertible, i.e., there is some scalar ${s}^{-1}$ such that $s\circ{s}^{-1}=$ $1$, and 2. there is some scalar ${1}^{-}\neq 1$ such that ${1}^{-}\circ{1}^{-}=$ $1$.
Definition 2 In an A-category, an arrow $f:A\rightarrow B$ is left-unitary iff $f\circ f^{\star}=$ ${id}_{B}$. It is right-unitary iff $f^{\star}\circ f=$ ${id}_{A}$. It is unitary iff it is both left-unitary and right-unitary.
Definition 23 An Az-category with unit object is said to be regular iff for any scalars $s,t:I\rightarrow I$ such that $s\circ t=$ ${0}_{I,I}$ one has either $s=$ ${0}_{I,I}$ or $t=$ ${0}_{I,I}$.
Definition 16 Let $A$, $B$ and $C$ be objects in an Az-category. The pair of arrows $u:A\rightarrow C$, $v:B\rightarrow C$ is said to be a u-coproduct for $A$ and $B$ iff: 1. they are a coproduct for $A$ and $B$, 2. the arrows $u$ and $v$ are right-unitary and orthogonal (see Definition 15). The definition of a u-product is dual: a product $p:C\rightarrow A$, $q:C\rightarrow B$ such that $p$ and $q$ are left-unitary and orthogonal.
Definition 7. Let $\mathcal{B}$ be an additive category and $\mathcal{X}$ a full subcategory. Given $M\in\mathcal{B}$, by an augmented proper right $\mathcal{X}$–resolution we understand a complex of the form $X_{M}:\qquad\dots\longrightarrow 0\longrightarrow 0\longrightarrow M% \longrightarrow X^{0}\longrightarrow X^{1}\longrightarrow X^{2}\longrightarrow\cdots,$ such that $X^{i}\in\mathcal{X}$ for all $i\geq 0$ and $\operatorname{Hom}_{\mathbf{K}({\mathcal{B}})}(X_{M},X^{\prime}[n])=0$ for all $X^{\prime}\in\mathcal{X}$ and $n\in\mathbb{Z}$.
Definition 6. Let $\mathcal{T}$ be a triangulated category with coproducts. A full triangulated subcategory $\mathcal{L}$ of $\mathcal{T}$ is called localizing if it is also closed under taking coproducts in $\mathcal{T}$. Given a class of objects $\mathcal{S}\subseteq\mathcal{T}$, we denote by $\mathrm{Loc}\,\mathcal{S}$ the smallest localizing subcategory of $\mathcal{T}$ containing $\mathcal{S}$. The category $\mathcal{T}$ is called locally well generated (in the sense of [20, Definition 3.1]) if for any set $\mathcal{S}$ (not a proper class!) of objects of $\mathcal{T}$, $\mathrm{Loc}\,\mathcal{S}$ is well generated.

We say that $C$ is firmly acyclic if $\operatorname{Hom}(C,F)$ is exact for all level left $R$-modules $F$. If $C$ is itself exact, we will call $C$ exact AC-acyclic or exact firmly acyclic as the case may be.

Definition 4.1. We say that a binary relation $R$ is left pseudoreflexive if there is a morphism $e\colon R\to R$ satisfying $de=ce=d$. $R$ is right pseudoreflexive if the opposite relation $R^{\circ}$ is left pseudoreflexive, and pseudoreflexive if both $R$ and $R^{\circ}$ are left pseudoreflexive.
