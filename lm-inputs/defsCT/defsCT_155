Definition 2.1 (Set of Attribute Lists). Let $\mathcal{A}$ denote the set of all attribute lists in $A$. For each $n\geq-1$, let $\mathcal{A}_{n}\subset\mathcal{A}$ denote the set of all attribute lists of length $n{+}1$. $\mathcal{A}$ is a small category. Using the notation from Appendix A, an object in $\mathcal{A}$ is a function $T:\mathbf{n}\to A$. The case $n=-1$, giving the empty list $T=[]$, is allowed. A morphism of attribute lists $T\to T^{\prime}$ is given by $\ell:\mathbf{n}^{\prime}\to\mathbf{n}$ (an order-preserving function, which is a morphism of $\mathbf{\Delta_{a}}$ as in Appendix A) such that $T^{\prime}=T\circ\ell$, which is natural for the commutative diagram (2.1). $\mathbf{n}$$A$$\mathbf{n^{\prime}}$$A$$\ell$$=$$T$$T^{\prime}$
Definition 3.16. Let $\mathcal{S}|_{T}\coloneqq\{(S,\sigma)\in\mathcal{S}\,:\,\exists\,\iota:S% \hookrightarrow T\}$, the set of data tables in the data subcomplex that are detected by $T$. Let $\mathcal{B}|_{T}\coloneqq\{S\in\mathcal{B}\,:\,\exists\,\iota:S\hookrightarrow T% \}=p(\mathcal{S}|_{T})$, the set of attribute lists in the subcomplex that are detected by $T$.
Definition 1.3. If $\mathcal{C}$ is a $\mathcal{V}$-enriched category and $X\in\mathcal{V}$, a homotopy-coherent trace functor from $\mathcal{C}$ to $X$ is a morphism $\text{THH}(\mathcal{C})\rightarrow X$.
Definition 3.5. A cyclic space $X$ is a presheaf on $\Lambda$. Call $\text{cTop}=\mathcal{P}(\Lambda)$.
Definition 2.1. A directed multigraph (or just graph) $\Gamma$ consists of a set $E$ of edges, a set $S$ of vertices, and two functions $s,t:E\rightarrow S$ called the source and target. We say $\Gamma$ is finite if $E$ is finite (even if $S$ is not). Given two directed multigraphs $\Gamma,\Gamma^{\prime}$ with identical sets of vertices, a bypass operation $f:\Gamma\rightarrow\Gamma^{\prime}$ is a function $f:E\rightarrow E^{\prime}$ along with a total ordering of the set $f^{-1}(e)$ for each $e\in E^{\prime}$, satisfying the properties: • If $f^{-1}(e)$ is empty, then $e$ is a loop; that is, $s(e)=t(e)$; • If $f^{-1}(e)=\{e_{1}<\cdots<e_{k}\}$, then $e_{1}\to\cdots\to e_{k}$ is a path from $s(e)$ to $t(e)$; that is, $t(e_{i})=s(e_{i+1})$ for $1\leq i<k$, $s(e_{1})=s(e)$, and $t(e_{k})=t(e)$.
Definition 7.1. Given a category $\mathcal{C}$, its cyclic nerve is the cyclic set $N_{\text{cyc}}\mathcal{C}=\text{Fun}(-,\mathcal{C}):\Lambda^{\text{op}}% \rightarrow\text{Set}.$
Definition 2.3. If $X_{i}\in S$, then $(X_{1},X_{2})\in\text{Bypass}_{S}$ denotes the graph with a single edge from $X_{1}$ to $X_{2}$. More generally, $(X_{1},X_{2},\ldots,X_{n})=(X_{1},X_{2})\otimes(X_{2},X_{3})\otimes\cdots% \otimes(X_{n-1},X_{n})$ denotes the graph with a single path $X_{1}\to\cdots\to X_{n}$.
Definition 3.2. Let $\text{Bypass}_{S}^{\text{Eul}}$ denote the category of (finite, nonempty) directed multigraphs with a chosen Eulerian tour, along with those morphisms $\Gamma\rightarrow\Gamma^{\prime}$ in $\text{Bypass}_{S}$ which pull back the chosen Eulerian tour on $\Gamma^{\prime}$ to the chosen Eulerian tour on $\Gamma$.
Definition 1.2. If $\mathcal{V}$ is a symmetric monoidal $\infty$-category1Since $\text{THH}(\mathcal{C})$ is a colimit, we should either assume $\mathcal{V}$ is presentable, or define $\text{THH}(\mathcal{C})$ as a presheaf on $\mathcal{V}$. We will ignore this unimportant subtlety in the introduction. and $\mathcal{C}$ is a $\mathcal{V}$-enriched category, $\text{THH}(\mathcal{C})\in\mathcal{V}$ is the geometric realization of the cyclic bar construction (in $\mathcal{V}$): $\text{THH}(\mathcal{C})_{n}=\coprod_{X_{0},\ldots,X_{n}\in\mathcal{C}}\text{% Hom}(X_{0},X_{1})\otimes\cdots\otimes\text{Hom}(X_{n},X_{0}).$
Definition 3.3 (Connes’ cyclic category [8]). Let $\mathbb{T}_{n}$ denote the category on objects $v_{i}$ generated by irreducible morphisms $e_{i}$: $v_{0}\xrightarrow{e_{0}}\cdots\xrightarrow{e_{n-1}}v_{n}\xrightarrow{e_{n}}v_{% 0}.$ We call this category a cyclically ordered set. Each object has a degree 1 endomorphism given by passing around this cycle once. The cyclic category $\Lambda$ is the category of finite cyclically ordered sets and functors between them which send degree 1 endomorphisms to degree 1 endomorphisms. We call these degree 1 functors.
Definition 2.4. If $\mathcal{V}$ is a symmetric monoidal $\infty$-category, a $\mathcal{V}$-enriched category with set $S$ of objects is a symmetric monoidal functor $\mathcal{C}:\text{Bypass}_{S}\rightarrow\mathcal{V}.$
Definition (2.4). If $\mathcal{V}$ is a symmetric monoidal $\infty$-category, a $\mathcal{V}$-enriched category with set $S$ of objects is a symmetric monoidal functor $\mathcal{C}:\text{Bypass}_{S}\rightarrow\mathcal{V}.$
Definition 3.1. If $\Gamma$ is a nonempty directed multigraph, an Eulerian tour on $\Gamma$ is a total ordering of the edges in such a way that they form a single cycle. (That is, it is a path which begins and ends at the same vertex, visiting each edge exactly once.) We will regard two Eulerian tours on $\Gamma$ as the same if they differ only by cyclic permutation.
Definition 2.2. Given a set $S$ (not necessarily finite), $\text{Bypass}_{S}$ is the category of finite directed multigraphs with fixed object set $S$, and bypass operations for morphisms.
Definition 4.1 (THH of an enriched category). If $\mathcal{C}:\text{Bypass}_{S}\rightarrow\mathcal{V}$ is a $\mathcal{V}$-enriched category with set $S$ of objects, then $\text{THH}(\mathcal{C})=\mathcal{C}_{\ast}(\mathcal{O}_{\text{thh}})$.
Definition 3.8. A cotilting object $C\in\mathcal{A}$ is called large if it is not equivalent to a coherent cotilting object.
Definition 2.2. Let $\mathcal{A}$ be a locally finitely presented abelian category. (1) An exact sequence $0\rightarrow A\stackrel{{\scriptstyle\alpha}}{{\rightarrow}}B\stackrel{{% \scriptstyle\beta}}{{\rightarrow}}C\rightarrow 0$ in $\mathcal{A}$ is called pure-exact, if for every $F\in\operatorname{fp}(\mathcal{A})$ the induced sequence $0\rightarrow\operatorname{Hom}_{\mathcal{A}}(F,A)\rightarrow\operatorname{Hom}% _{\mathcal{A}}(F,B)\rightarrow\operatorname{Hom}_{\mathcal{A}}(F,C)\rightarrow 0$ is exact. In this case $\alpha$ (resp. $\beta$) is called a pure monomorphism (resp. pure epimorphism), and $A$ a pure subobject of $B$. (2) A pure-essential morphism is a pure-monomorphism $j$ in $\mathcal{A}$ such that, if $fj$ is a pure monomorphism for some morphism $f$ in $\mathcal{A}$, then $f$ is a pure monomorphism. (3) An object $E\in\mathcal{A}$ is called pure-injective if for every pure-exact sequence $0\rightarrow A\rightarrow B\rightarrow C\rightarrow 0$ the induced sequence $0\rightarrow\operatorname{Hom}_{\mathcal{A}}(C,E)\rightarrow\operatorname{Hom}% _{\mathcal{A}}(B,E)\rightarrow\operatorname{Hom}_{\mathcal{A}}(A,E)\rightarrow 0$ is exact. (4) For an object $M$ in $\mathcal{A}$, a pure-injective envelope of $M$ is a pure-essential morphism $M\to N$ where $N$ is pure-injective. (5) An object $N$ is called superdecomposable if $N$ has no nonzero indecomposable direct summands. (6) An object $E\in\mathcal{A}$ is called $\Sigma$-pure-injective if the coproduct $E^{(I)}$ is pure-injective for every set $I$. (7) An object $Y\in\mathcal{A}$ is called fp-injective if $\operatorname{Ext}^{1}_{\mathcal{A}}(X,Y)=0$ for every $X\in\operatorname{fp}(\mathcal{A})$.
Definition 3.1 ([10, Def. 2.4]). An object $C\in\mathcal{A}$ is called a cotilting object if $\operatorname{Cogen}(C)={}^{\perp_{1}}C$, and if this class contains a generator for $\mathcal{A}$. Then $\operatorname{Cogen}(C)$ is called the associated cotilting class.
Definition 3.9. Let $E\in\mathcal{A}$. (1) $E$ is called rigid, if $\operatorname{Ext}^{1}(E,E)=0$. (2) $E$ is called self-orthogonal, if $\operatorname{Ext}^{1}(E^{\alpha},E)=0$ for every cardinal $\alpha$. (3) A self-orthogonal $E$ is called maximal self-orthogonal, if $\operatorname{Prod}(E)\subseteq\operatorname{Prod}(F)$ implies $\operatorname{Prod}(E)=\operatorname{Prod}(F)$ for every self-orthogonal $F$.
Definition 3.6. (1) Two cotilting objects $C$, $C^{\prime}\in\mathcal{A}$ are equivalent, if they have the same cotilting class. This is equivalent to $\operatorname{Prod}(C)=\operatorname{Prod}(C^{\prime})$. (2) A cotilting object $C\in\mathcal{A}$ is called minimal if, for any other cotilting object $C^{\prime}$ with same cotilting class $\operatorname{Cogen}(C^{\prime})=\operatorname{Cogen}(C)$, we have that $C$ is a direct summand of $C^{\prime}$.
Definition 4.10. A function $\alpha\colon H\times N\to N$ is an action with respect to an admissible quotient $Q$ of $N\times H$ if it satisfies the following conditions: (1) $(n_{1},h)\sim(n_{2},h)$ implies $n_{1}\ast[\alpha(h,n),h]=n_{2}\ast[\alpha(h,n),h]$, (2) $(n,h^{\prime})\sim(n^{\prime},h^{\prime})$ implies $[\alpha(h,n),h]\ast h^{\prime}=[\alpha(h,n^{\prime}),h]\ast h^{\prime}$, (3) $[\alpha(h,nn^{\prime}),h]=[\alpha(h,n)\cdot\alpha(h,n^{\prime}),h]$, (4) $[\alpha(hh^{\prime},n),hh^{\prime}]=[\alpha(h,\alpha(h^{\prime},n)),hh^{\prime}]$, (5) $[\alpha(h,1),h]=[1,h]$, (6) $[\alpha(1,n),1]=[n,1]$.
Definition 4.1. Let $E$ be an equivalence relation on $N\times H$ satisfying the following conditions. (1) $(n_{1},1)\sim(n_{2},1)$ implies $n_{1}=n_{2}$, (2) $(n_{1},h_{1})\sim(n_{2},h_{2})$ implies $h_{1}=h_{2}$, (3) for all $n\in N$, $(n_{1},h)\sim(n_{2},h)$ implies $(nn_{1},h)\sim(nn_{2},h)$ and (4) for all $h^{\prime}\in H$, $(n_{1},h)\sim(n_{2},h)$ implies $(n_{1},hh^{\prime})\sim(n_{2},hh^{\prime})$. Then the induced quotient $N\times H/E$ we call an admissible quotient.
Definition 4.15. Let $\mathrm{WAct}(H,N)$ be the preorder whose objects are pairs $(Q,[\alpha])$ where $Q$ is an admissible quotient on $N\times H$ and $[\alpha]\in\mathrm{Act}_{Q}/\hskip-2.845276pt\sim$. We say that $(Q,[\alpha])\leq(Q^{\prime},[\alpha^{\prime}])$ if and only if $(n,h)\sim_{Q}(n^{\prime},h)$ implies that $(n,h)\sim_{Q^{\prime}}(n^{\prime},h)$ and $(\alpha(h,n),h)\sim_{Q^{\prime}}(\alpha^{\prime}(h,n),h)$.
Definition 2.1. The category $\mathrm{SplExt}(H,N)$ has split extensions of $H$ by $N$ as objects and, as morphisms, monoid maps $f\colon G_{1}\to G_{2}$ making the squares in the following diagram commute. $N$$G_{1}$$H$$N$$G_{2}$$H$$k_{1}$$e_{1}$$s_{1}$$k_{2}$$e_{2}$$s_{2}$$f$
Definition 2.4. The category $\mathrm{WSExt}(H,N)$ is the full subcategory of $\mathrm{SplExt}(H,N)$ consisting of the weakly Schreier extensions.
Definition 5.8. Let $E$ be the equivalence relation given by $(n,h)\sim(n^{\prime},h)$ implies $n=n^{\prime}$ whenever $h\in L(H)$ and $(n,h)\sim(n^{\prime},h)$ for all $n,n^{\prime}\in N$ whenever $h\in\overline{L(H)}$. We call the quotient $Q$ induced by $E$, the coarse quotient on $N\times H$.
Definition 2.5. Let ${N}$${G}$${H}$${k}$${e}$${s}$ be a weakly Schreier extension and let $\varphi\colon N\times H\to G$ denote the surjective map sending $(n,h)$ to $k(n)\cdot s(h)$. Then let $E(e,s)$ denote the equivalence relation on $N\times H$ induced by $\varphi$ where $(n,h)\sim(n^{\prime},h^{\prime})$ if and only if $k(n)\cdot s(h)=k(n^{\prime})\cdot s(h^{\prime})$.
Definition 2.2. A split extension ${N}$${G}$${H}$${k}$${e}$${s}$ is called weakly Schreier when every element of $g\in G$ can be written as $g=k(n)\cdot s(h)$ for some $n\in N$ and $h\in H$.
Definition 10. Working in some ambient category $\mathbf{E}$, an internal category $\mathbf{C}$ is a collection of objects and morphisms satisfying the following diagram, with the axioms of category theory expressed as commutative diagrams.
Definition 8. $A\Rightarrow B$ denotes the set of functions between sets A and B. If $A\Rightarrow B$ satisfies the conditions of an exponential we denote it $B^{A}$.9In this sense, NF gives us a stark example of a situation where an object satisfying a universal property may be very different from the object which is the predicate-in-extension of the intuitive set-theoretic definition.
Definition 13. Let $\mathbf{C}$ be a category of classes, we define a system of small maps on $\mathbf{C}$ as a collection of arrows $\mathbf{S}$ satisfying the following: (i) $\mathbf{S}\subset\mathbf{C}$ is a subcategory of $\mathbf{C}$, with $Ob(\mathbf{S})=Ob(\mathbf{C})$ (ii) The pullback of a small map along any map is small. (iii) Diagonals $\Delta:C\to C\times C$ are small (iv) If $f\circ e$ is small and $e$ is a regular epimorphism, then $f$ is small. (v) Copairs of small maps are small.
Definition 2. To denote the singleton of a set $x$, $\{x\}$, we write $\iota`x$, with $\iota``x$ denoting the set of singletons of elements of $x$, $\{\{y\}|y\in x\}$.
Definition 6. IO is the principle that every set is the same size as a set of singletons.
Definition 14. For every object $C$ in a class category $\mathbf{C}$, a powerclass is an object PC with a small relation $\epsilon_{C}\to C\times\textbf{P}C$ such that, for any $X$ and any small relation $R\to C\times X$, there is a unique arrow $\rho$ satisfying the pullback diagram below: $\xymatrix{R\ar[r]\ar[d]&\epsilon_{C}\ar[d]\\ C\times X\ar[r]_{1_{C}\times\rho}&C\times\textbf{P}C}$ In addition, $\textbf{P}C$ satisfies the condition that the internal subset relation $\subset_{C}\to\textbf{P}C\times\textbf{P}C$ is small.
Definition 9. We give a precise definition of pseudo-powerobjects, satisfying the following universal property: for a subobject of $R\hookrightarrow TA\times B$, there is a unique morphism $\hat{r}:B\to PA$ such that the following diagram commutes, where $r$ is the characteristic morphism of $R$: $\xymatrix{B\ar[d]^{\hat{r}}&TA\times B\ar[r]^{<}<<<{r}\ar[d]^{1_{TA}\times\hat% {r}}&2\ar@{=}[d]\\ PA&TA\times PA\ar[r]_{<}<<<{\in_{A}}&2}$ We refer to $\hat{r}$ as the P-transpose of $r$.
Definition 1. For some function $f$, we define $f``$ as $f$ “acting one level down," thus $f``X=\{f(x)|x\in X\}$. For $f(x)$ we sometimes write $f`x$, when it is helpful to do so. $f``$ is often written $j(f)$ (for $j$ump), allowing one to generalize to $j^{n}(f)$, the function obtained by applying $f$ $n$ levels down.
Definition 5. The T-functor is defined by its action on objects, $x\mapsto\iota``x$, and its action on maps, $f:A\to B\mapsto Tf:TA\to TB$ defined as $\langle\{a\},\{b\}\rangle\in Tf$ where $\langle a,b\rangle$ is in $f$.
Definition 12. A category of classes $\mathbf{C}$ is a category with the following conditions: (i) $\mathbf{C}$ has finite limits and finite coproducts (ii) $\mathbf{C}$ has kernel quotients, and regular epis are stable under pullback. (iii) $\mathbf{C}$ has dual images, that is, for every arrow $f:C\to D$, the pullback functor $f^{*}:Sub(D)\to Sub(C)$ has a right adjoint, $f_{*}:Sub(D)\to Sub(C)$.
Definition 3. We say that a set $x$ is cantorian if $|x|=|\iota``x|$.
Definition 7. CE is the principle that a family of pairwise disjoint sets is the same size as a set of singletons.
Definition 11. Let $\mathbf{C}\in\mathbf{cat(E)}$. An internal diagram F on $\mathbf{C}$ is a collection $(F_{0},\gamma_{0},e)$ such that: (i) $\gamma_{0}:F_{0}\to C_{0}$ $\in\mathbf{E}/C_{0}$ (ii) $e:F_{1}=F_{0}\times_{d_{0}}C_{1}\to F_{0}$ with the following commutatitivity conditions: $\gamma_{0}\circ e=d_{1}\circ\pi_{2}$ $e(1\times i)=1_{F_{0}}$ $e(e\times 1)=e(1\times m):F_{2}=F_{0}\times_{C_{0}}C_{1}\times_{C_{0}}C_{1}\to F% _{0}.$
Definition 4. A set is said to be strongly cantorian if the graph of $\iota\restriction x$ is a set (hence, witnessing $Can(x)$).
Definition 4.1. ([AR94, 1.49]) A limit sketch is a couple $(\mathbf{T},L)$ where $\mathbf{T}$ is a small category and $L$ is a collection of cones in $\mathbf{T}$.
Definition 4.6. Let $(\mathbf{T},L)$ be a limit sketch, we say that it is fully faithful if for any $t\in\mathbf{T}$, the functor $\mathbf{T}(t,-)$ is a model for $(\mathbf{T},L)$.
Definition 2.1. A $\lambda$-locally presentable category is a category $\mathbf{C}$ that is equivalent to $\mathsf{Ind}_{\lambda}(A)$ with $A$ a small category with all $\lambda$-small colimits. A locally presentable category is a category that is $\lambda$-locally presentable for some $\lambda$.
Definition 4.2. A finite connected limit sketch is a sketch $(\mathbf{T},L)$ such that all cones in $L$ are indexed by finite connected diagrams.
Definition 5.4.2. A lax wedge $\psi$ for $F$ with vertex $X$ consists of • $\forall x\in P$, a 2-functor $\psi_{x}:F(x,x)\to X$. • $\forall f:x\to y\in P$, a 2-natural transformation $\psi_{f}:\psi_{x}F(f,1)\to\psi_{y}F(1,f)$. • $\forall$ 2-cells $\alpha:f\to g$ in $P$, a modification $\xygraph{!{0;(2.5,0):(0,.4)::}{\psi_{x}F(f,1)}="p0"[r]{\psi_{x}F(g,1)}="p1"[d]% {\psi_{y}F(1,g)}="p2"[l]{\psi_{y}F(1,f)}="p3""p0":"p1"^{-}{\psi_{x}F(\alpha,% \textnormal{id})}:"p2"^{-}{\psi_{g}}:@{<-}"p3"^{-}{\psi_{y}F(\textnormal{id},% \alpha)}:@{<-}"p0"^{-}{\psi_{f}}"p0"[d(.55)r(.43)]:@{=>}[r(.14)]^{-}{\psi_{% \alpha}}}$ subject to the unit, 1-cell composition, 2-cell vertical composition and 2-cell horizonal composition axioms. The unit axioms say that $\forall x\in P$, $\psi_{1_{x}}=1_{\psi_{x}}$, and $\forall f:x\to y\in P$, $\psi_{\textnormal{id}_{f}}=\textnormal{id}_{\psi_{f}}$. The 1-cell composition axiom says that given $f:x\to y$ and $g:y\to z$ in $P$, $\psi_{gf}=(\psi_{g}F(1,f))(\psi_{f}F(g,1))$. The 2-cell vertical composition axiom says that given $\alpha$ and $\beta$ in $P$ as on the left in $\xygraph{{\xybox{\xygraph{{x}="p0"[r(1.25)]{y}="p1""p0":@/^{2pc}/"p1"^{-}{f}|-% {}="t""p0":"p1"|-{g}="m""p0":@/_{2pc}/"p1"_{-}{h}|{}="b""t":@{}"m"|(.25){}="d1% "|(.75){}="c1""m":@{}"b"|(.25){}="d2"|(.75){}="c2""d1":@{=>}"c1"^{-}{\alpha}"d% 2":@{=>}"c2"^{-}{\beta}}}}[r(6)]{\xybox{\xygraph{!{0;(2.5,0):(0,.4)::}{\psi_{x% }F(f,1)}="p0"[r]{\psi_{x}F(g,1)}="p1"[r]{\psi_{x}F(h,1)}="p2"[d]{\psi_{y}F(1,h% )}="p3"[l]{\psi_{y}F(1,g)}="p4"[l]{\psi_{y}F(1,f)}="p5""p0":"p1"^{-}{\psi_{x}F% (\alpha,\textnormal{id})}:"p2"^{-}{\psi_{x}F(\beta,\textnormal{id})}:"p3"^{-}{% \psi_{h}}:@{<-}"p4"^{-}{\psi_{y}F(\textnormal{id},\beta)}:@{<-}"p5"^{-}{\psi_{% y}F(\textnormal{id},\alpha)}:@{<-}"p0"^{-}{\psi_{f}}"p1":"p4"^{\psi_{g}}"p0"[d% (.55)r(.43)]:@{=>}[r(.14)]^{-}{\psi_{\alpha}}"p1"[d(.55)r(.43)]:@{=>}[r(.14)]^% {-}{\psi_{\beta}}}}}}$ the composite on the right in the previous display equals $\psi_{\beta\alpha}$. The 2-cell horizontal composition axiom says that given $\alpha$ and $\beta$ in $P$ as on the left in $\xygraph{{\xybox{\xygraph{{x}="p0"[r]{y}="p1"[r]{z}="p2""p0":@/^{1pc}/"p1"^{-}% {f}|-{}="tl":@/^{1pc}/"p2"^{-}{g}|-{}="tr""p0":@/_{1pc}/"p1"_{-}{h}|-{}="bl":@% /_{1pc}/"p2"_{-}{k}|-{}="br""tl":@{}"bl"|(.25){}="d1"|(.75){}="c1""tr":@{}"br"% |(.25){}="d2"|(.75){}="c2""d1":@{=>}"c1"^{-}{\alpha}"d2":@{=>}"c2"^{-}{\beta}}% }}[r(6)]{\xybox{\xygraph{!{0;(2.5,0):(0,.4)::}{\psi_{x}F(gf,1)}="p0"[r]{\psi_{% y}F(g,f)}="p1"[r]{\psi_{z}F(1,gf)}="p2"[d]{\psi_{z}F(1,kh)}="p3"[l]{\psi_{y}F(% k,h)}="p4"[l]{\psi_{x}F(kh,1)}="p5""p0":"p1"^{-}{\psi_{f}F(g,1)}:"p2"^{-}{\psi% _{g}F(1,f)}:"p3"^{-}{\psi_{z}F(1,\beta\cdot\alpha)}:@{<-}"p4"^{-}{\psi_{k}F(1,% h)}:@{<-}"p5"^{-}{\psi_{h}F(k,1)}:@{<-}"p0"^{-}{\psi_{x}F(\beta\cdot\alpha,% \textnormal{id})}"p1":"p4"|-{\psi_{y}F(\beta,\alpha)}"p0"[d(.35)r(.2)]:@{=>}[d% (.3)]^{-}{\psi_{\alpha}F(\beta,\textnormal{id})}"p1"[d(.35)r(.35)]:@{=>}[d(.3)% ]^{-}{\psi_{\beta}F(\textnormal{id},\alpha)}}}}}$ the composite on the right in the previous display equals $\psi_{\beta\cdot\alpha}$.
Definition 3.2.1. An adjunction $F:(\mathcal{L},S)\to(\mathcal{K},T)$ of 2-monads is internalisable when (1) $\mathcal{K}$ and $\mathcal{L}$ have all limits and colimits, (2) $\mathcal{K}$ is of the form $\textnormal{Cat}(\mathcal{E})$ for some category $\mathcal{E}$ with pullbacks, (3) $S$ and $T$ have rank1This means that the underlying endofunctors of $S$ and $T$ preserve $\lambda$-filtered colimits for some regular cardinal $\lambda$., and (4) $T$ preserves internal functors whose object maps are invertible.
Definition 4.6.4. [32, 34] Suppose that $\mathcal{K}$ and $\mathcal{L}$ have comma objects and $\mathcal{K}$ has a terminal object $1$. (1) An opfamilial 2-functor $T:\mathcal{K}\to\mathcal{L}$ is a local right adjoint equipped with $\overline{T}_{1}:\mathcal{K}\to{\Psi_{T1}}\textnormal{-Alg}_{\textnormal{s}}$ such that $U^{\Psi_{T1}}\overline{T}_{1}=T_{1}$. (2) A 2-natural transformation $\phi:S\to T$ between opfamilial 2-functors is opfamilial when its naturality squares are pullbacks, and when for all $X\in\mathcal{K}$, $\alpha$’s naturality square with respect to the unique map $t_{X}:X\to 1$ is a morphism of split opfibrations $(\alpha_{X},\alpha_{1}):St_{X}\to Tt_{X}$. (3) An opfamilial 2-monad is a 2-monad whose underlying endo-2-functor, unit and multiplication are opfamilial.
Definition 2.4.3. Let $(\mathcal{K},T)$ be a 2-monad, suppose that $\mathcal{K}$ has comma objects and let $(f,\overline{f}):(A,a)\to(B,b)$ be a colax morphism of pseudo $T$-algebras. Then $(f,\overline{f})$ is exact when the square $\xygraph{!{0;(1.5,0):(0,.6667)::}{TA}="p0"[r]{TB}="p1"[d]{B}="p2"[l]{A}="p3""p% 0":"p1"^{-}{Tf}:"p2"^{-}{b}:@{<-}"p3"^{-}{f}:@{<-}"p0"^{-}{a}"p0"[d(.55)r(.4)]% :@{=>}[r(.2)]^{-}{\overline{f}}}$ is exact in the sense of Definition 2.4.1.
