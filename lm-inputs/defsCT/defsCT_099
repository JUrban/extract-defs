Definition 1.9. We say that a phantom subcategory ${\mathcal{A}}\subset\mathbf{D}^{b}(\operatorname{coh}X)$ is a universal phantom if ${\mathcal{A}}\boxtimes\mathbf{D}^{b}(\operatorname{coh}Y)\subset\mathbf{D}^{b}% (\operatorname{coh}(X\times Y))$ is also phantom for any smooth projective variety $Y.$
Definition 1.3. A collection of admissible subcategories $({{\mathcal{N}}}_{1},\dots,{{\mathcal{N}}}_{n})$ in a triangulated category ${{\mathcal{D}}}$ is said to be semiorthogonal if the condition ${{\mathcal{N}}}_{j}\subset{{\mathcal{N}}}^{\perp}_{i}$ holds when $j<i$ for any $1\leq i\leq n.$ A semiorthogonal collection is said to be full if it generates the category ${{\mathcal{D}}},$ i.e. the minimal triangulated subcategory of ${\mathcal{D}}$ containing all ${\mathcal{N}}_{j}$ coincides with the whole ${\mathcal{D}}.$ In this case we call it by a semiorthogonal decomposition of the category ${{\mathcal{D}}}$ and denote this as ${{\mathcal{D}}}=\left\langle{{\mathcal{N}}}_{1},\dots,{{\mathcal{N}}}_{n}% \right\rangle.$
Definition 4.1. The crossed product of $G$ and $\cal C$ will be the double commutant in ${\sf Hilb}_{\tilde{\mbox{$\sf H$}}}$ of the images of $G[1]$ and $\cal C$ under the functors $\lambda$ and $\pi$.
Definition 3.1. • An Ab-premonoidal category is a premonoidal category $\cal{C}$ such that for all objects $X,Y$ in $\cal{C}$ the set ${\cal C}(X,Y)$ is equipped with an abelian group structure. Moveover if $f,g\in{\cal C}(X,Y)$ and $h\in{\cal C}(A,X)$ and $k\in{\cal C}(Y,B)$ then $(f+g)\circ h=f\circ h+g\circ h$ and $k\circ(f+g)=k\circ f+k\circ g$. In addition we also require that for all objects $A$ the functions $A\otimes-:{\cal C}(X,Y)\longrightarrow{\cal C}(A\otimes X,A\otimes Y)$ and $-\otimes A:{\cal C}(X,Y)\longrightarrow{\cal C}(X\otimes A,Y\otimes A)$ are group homomorphisms for all objects $X$, $Y$ in ${\cal C}$. • A $\mathbb{C}$-linear premonoidal category is a a premonoidal category $\cal{C}$ in which every hom-set ${\cal C}(X,Y)$ is a complex vector space and the composition map $(f,g)\mapsto g\circ f$ is bilinear and the functions $A\otimes-:{\cal C}(X,Y)\longrightarrow{\cal C}(A\otimes X,A\otimes Y)$ and $-\otimes A:{\cal C}(X,Y)\longrightarrow{\cal C}(X\otimes A,Y\otimes A)$ are $\sf{C}$-linear for all objects $A$, $X$, and $Y$ in $\cal{C}$. • A positive $\ast$-operation on a $\mathbb{C}$-linear premonoidal category $\cal{C}$ is a family of functions assigning to each arrow $s\in{\cal C}(X,Y)$ an arrow $s^{\ast}\in{\cal C}(Y,X)$ with $(g\circ f)^{\ast}=f^{\ast}\circ g^{\ast}$ for composable arrows $f$ and $g$ and $id_{A}^{\ast}=id_{A}$. The map $s\mapsto s^{\ast}$ must be antilinear, and satisfy $(s^{\ast})^{\ast}=s$ and if $s^{\ast}\circ s=0$ then $s=0$. We also require that for all arrows $g$ in $\cal{C}$ and objects $A$, that $(A\otimes f)^{\ast}=A\otimes f^{\ast}$ and $(f\otimes A)^{\ast}=f^{\ast}\otimes A$. Finally we will insist that $\alpha^{\ast}=\alpha^{-1}$, $\lambda^{\ast}=\lambda^{-1}$, and $\rho^{\ast}=\rho^{-1}$ and in the case of symmetry that $\tau^{\ast}=\tau^{-1}$. A $\mathbb{C}$-linear premonoidal category equipped with a positive $\ast$-operation is called a premonoidal $\ast$-category. • A premonoidal $C^{\ast}$-category is a premonoidal $\ast$-category $\mathcal{C}$ such that $\mathcal{C}(X,Y)$ is a Banach space with norm denoted by $\|\cdot\|$ such that $\|s\circ t\|\leq\|s\|\|t\|$ and $\|s^{\ast}\circ s\|=\|s\|^{2}$ and $\|A\otimes s\|=\|s\|=\|s\otimes A\|$ for all $s:X\longrightarrow Y$ and $t:Y\longrightarrow Z$ and objects $A$. If the category happens to be monoidal, we say that the category is a $C^{\ast}$-tensor category.
Definition 2.8. If $\cal{C}$ is a premonoidal category then the centre of $\cal{C}$ is the category $\cal{Z}(\cal{C})$ with objects the same as those of $\cal{C}$ and its arrows are the central maps in $\cal{C}$.
Definition 3.5. Let $\mathcal{A}\subseteq\mathcal{C}$ be a premonoidal $C^{\ast}$-subcategory of a premonoidal $C^{\ast}$-category $\mathcal{C}$. Then $\mathcal{A}$ is called a $\mathcal{C}$-von Neumann category just in case $\mathcal{A}^{\prime\prime}(X,Y)=\mathcal{A}(X,Y)$ for all objects $X$ and $Y$ in $\mathcal{A}$. When $\mathcal{C}=\mathbf{Hilb}_{\mbox{$\sf H$}}$ then $\mathcal{A}$ is simply called a von Neumann category.
Definition 2.1. A binoidal category consists of a category $\cal{C}$ and functors $H_{B}:\cal{C}\longrightarrow\cal{C}$ and $K_{B}:\cal{C}\longrightarrow\cal{C}$ for all objects $B$ in $\cal{C}$ and satisfying $H_{B}(C)=K_{C}(B)$ for all pairs of objects $B$.
Definition 2.3. If $\cal{C}$ is a binoidal category and $G,H:\cal{B}\longrightarrow\cal{C}$ are functors then a natural transformation $\alpha:G\Longrightarrow H$ is central if its components $\alpha_{B}:G(B)\longrightarrow H(B)$ are central maps in $\cal{C}$.
Definition 2.2. If $\cal{C}$ is a binoidal category and $f:A\longrightarrow C$ and $g:B\longrightarrow D$ are arrows, define $g\rtimes f=(g\otimes C)(B\otimes f)\mbox{\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,and \,\,\,\,\,\,% \,\,\,\,\,}g\ltimes f=(D\otimes f)(g\otimes A).$ Then we say that $f$ is central if for all arrows $g$, $g\rtimes f=g\ltimes f\mbox{\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,and\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,}f% \rtimes g=f\ltimes g$
Definition 2.4. A premonoidal category consists of a binoidal category $\cal{C}$ together with a distinguished object $I\in|\cal{C}|$ and central natural isomorphisms $\alpha$, $\lambda$ and $\rho$ with components $\alpha_{A,B,C}:(A\otimes B)\otimes C\longrightarrow A\otimes(B\otimes C)$, $\lambda_{A}:I\otimes A\longrightarrow A$, and $\rho_{A}:A\otimes I\longrightarrow A$. These structural isomorphisms must satisfy the same coherence equations as in the definition of a monoidal category [12]. A premonoidal category is symmetric if there is a central natural isomorphism $\tau\colon A\otimes B\rightarrow B\otimes A$, again satisfying the usual equations.
Definition 3.3. Let $\mathcal{A}$ be a set of objects and arrows in a $*$-premonoidal category $\mathcal{C}$. Then the commutant of $\mathcal{A}$, denoted $\mathcal{A}^{\prime}$, will be the category with objects the same as those of $\mathcal{C}$ and its arrows will be arrows $f:A\longrightarrow B$ in $\mathcal{C}$ such that $f\ltimes g=f\rtimes g$ and $g\ltimes f=g\rtimes f$ for all arrows $g$ in $\mathcal{A}$.
Definition 1 The join functor is defined to be the composition $\mathrmbfit{join}=\mathrmbfit{dgm}^{\mathrm{op}}\circ\mathrmbfit{lim}:{% \mathrmbf{Db}}^{\mathrm{op}}\rightarrow\mathrmbf{Tbl}.$

Definition 4.4. A geometrical module category $\mathcal{N}$ over $\text{Rep}(G)$ is an exact module category $\mathcal{N}$ such that $\text{Fun}_{\text{Rep}(G)}(\text{Rep}(\{1\},1),\mathcal{N}_{i})\neq 0$ for any indecomposable direct summand module category $\mathcal{N}_{i}$ of $\mathcal{N}$.
Definition 5.4. A rigid tensor category which is tensor equivalent to some ${\mathcal{C}}(G,H,\omega,\psi)$ is called a group scheme theoretical category.
Definition 2.9. (cf. [EO]) Let $\mathcal{M}$ be an exact module category over $\mathcal{C}$. We say that an object $\delta\in\mathcal{M}$ generates $\mathcal{M}$ if for any $M\in\mathcal{M}$ there exists $X\in\mathcal{C}$ such that $\text{Hom}_{\mathcal{M}}(X\otimes^{\mathcal{M}}\delta,M)\neq 0$.
Definition 3.2. Let $\psi:H\times H\to\mathbb{G}_{m}$ be a normalized $2-$cocycle on a closed group subscheme $H$ of $G$. 1) An $(H,\psi)-$equivariant coherent sheaf on $G$ is a pair $(S,\lambda_{S})$, where $S\in\text{Coh}(G)$ and $\lambda_{S}$ is an isomorphism $\lambda_{S}:(\text{p}_{GH}^{1})^{*}(S)\to\mu^{*}(S)$ of sheaves on $G\times H$ such that the diagram of morphisms of sheaves on $G\times H\times H$ $\xymatrix{(\text{p}_{GHH}^{1})^{*}(S)\ar[d]_{(id\times m_{|H})^{*}(\lambda_{S}% )}\ar[rr]^{(\text{p}_{GHH}^{12})^{*}(\lambda_{S})}&&\mu^{*}(S)\ar[d]^{(\mu% \times id)^{*}(\lambda_{S})}&&\\ \eta^{*}(S)\ar[rr]_{id\boxtimes\psi}&&\eta^{*}(S)&&}$ is commutative. 2) Let $(S,\lambda_{S})$ and $(T,\lambda_{T})$ be two $(H,\psi)-$equivariant coherent sheaves on $G$. A morphism $\phi:S\to T$ in $\text{Coh}(G)$ is said to be $(H,\psi)-$equivariant if the diagram of morphisms of sheaves on $G\times H$ $\xymatrix{(p_{GH}^{1})^{*}(S)\ar[d]_{\lambda_{S}}\ar[rr]^{(p_{GH}^{1})^{*}(% \phi)}&&(p_{GH}^{1})^{*}(T)\ar[d]^{\lambda_{T}}&&\\ \mu^{*}(S)\ar[rr]_{\mu^{*}(\phi)}&&\mu^{*}(T)&&}$ is commutative. 3) Let $\text{Coh}_{f}^{(H,\psi)}(G)$ be the abelian category of $(H,\psi)-$equivariant coherent sheaves on $G$ with finite support in $G/H$ (i.e., sheaves supported on finitely many $H-$cosets), with $(H,\psi)-$equivariant morphisms.
Definition 2.5. (cf. [EO]) A module category $\mathcal{M}$ over $\mathcal{C}$ is called exact if any additive module functor $\mathcal{M}\to\mathcal{M}_{1}$ from $\mathcal{M}$ to any other $\mathcal{C}-$module category $\mathcal{M}_{1}$ is exact.
Definition 4.7. Let $H$ be a finite group scheme over $k$. We call a $2-$cocycle $\psi:H\times H\to\mathbb{G}_{m}$ (equivalently, a twist $\psi$ for $\mathcal{O}(H)=k[H]^{*}$) nondegenerate if the category $\text{Corep}(\mathcal{O}(H)_{\psi})$ of finite dimensional comodules over $\mathcal{O}(H)_{\psi}$ is equivalent to Vec (i.e., if the coalgebra $\mathcal{O}(H)_{\psi}$ is simple).
Definition 3.1.1 Let $X$ be an algebraic variety with Gorenstein and rational singularities. A categorical resolution of singularities of $X$ is a triangulated category $\mathscr{T}$ with a functor $\mathrm{\textbf{R}}{\pi_{\mathscr{T}}}_{*}:\mathscr{T}\rightarrow\mathrm{D^{b}% }(X)$ such that: • there exists a resolution of singularities $\pi:\tilde{X}\rightarrow X$ such that $\delta:\mathscr{T}\hookrightarrow\mathrm{D^{b}}(\tilde{X})$ is admissible and $\mathrm{\textbf{R}}{\pi_{\mathscr{T}}}_{*}=\mathrm{\textbf{R}}\pi_{*}\circ\delta$, • we have $\mathrm{\textbf{L}}\pi^{*}\mathrm{D^{perf}}(X)\subset\mathscr{T}$ and for all $\mathscr{F}\in\mathrm{D^{perf}}(X)$: $\mathrm{\textbf{R}}{\pi_{\mathscr{T}}}_{*}\mathrm{\textbf{L}}\pi_{\mathscr{T}}% ^{*}\mathscr{F}\simeq\mathscr{F},$ where $\mathrm{\textbf{L}}\pi_{\mathscr{T}}^{*}$ is the left adjoint to $\mathrm{\textbf{R}}{\pi_{\mathscr{T}}}_{*}$. If for all $\mathscr{F}\in\mathrm{D^{perf}}(X)$, there is a quasi-isomorphism: $\mathrm{\textbf{L}}\pi_{\mathscr{T}}^{*}\mathscr{F}\simeq\mathrm{\textbf{L}}% \pi_{\mathscr{T}}^{!}\mathscr{F},$ where $\mathrm{\textbf{L}}\pi_{\mathscr{T}}^{!}$ is the right adjoint of $\mathrm{\textbf{R}}{\pi_{\mathscr{T}}}_{*}$, we say that $\mathscr{T}$ is weakly crepant.
Definition 1.0.2 Let $X$ be an algebraic variety with Gorenstein and rational singularities. A categorical resolution of singularities of $X$ is a triangulated category $\mathscr{T}$ with a functor $\mathrm{\textbf{R}}{\pi_{\mathscr{T}}}_{*}:\mathscr{T}\rightarrow\mathrm{D^{b}% }(X)$ such that: • there exists a resolution of singularities $\pi:\tilde{X}\rightarrow X$ such that $\delta:\mathscr{T}\hookrightarrow\mathrm{D^{b}}(\tilde{X})$ is admissible and $\mathrm{\textbf{R}}{\pi_{\mathscr{T}}}_{*}=\mathrm{\textbf{R}}\pi_{*}\circ\delta$, • we have $\mathrm{\textbf{L}}\pi^{*}\mathrm{D^{perf}}(X)\subset\mathscr{T}$ and for all $\mathscr{F}\in\mathrm{D^{perf}}(X)$: $\mathrm{\textbf{R}}{\pi_{\mathscr{T}}}_{*}\mathrm{\textbf{L}}\pi_{\mathscr{T}}% ^{*}\mathscr{F}\simeq\mathscr{F},$ where $\mathrm{\textbf{L}}\pi_{\mathscr{T}}^{*}$ is the left adjoint to $\mathrm{\textbf{R}}{\pi_{\mathscr{T}}}_{*}$. If for all $\mathscr{F}\in\mathrm{D^{perf}}(X)$, there is a quasi-isomorphism: $\mathrm{\textbf{L}}\pi_{\mathscr{T}}^{*}\mathscr{F}\simeq\mathrm{\textbf{L}}% \pi_{\mathscr{T}}^{!}\mathscr{F},$ where $\mathrm{\textbf{L}}\pi_{\mathscr{T}}^{!}$ is the right adjoint of $\mathrm{\textbf{R}}{\pi_{\mathscr{T}}}_{*}$, we say that $\mathscr{T}$ is weakly crepant. Finally, if $\mathscr{T}$ has a structure of module category over $\mathrm{D^{perf}}(X)$ and the identity is a relative Serre functor for $\mathscr{T}$ with respect to $\mathrm{D^{b}}(X)$, then $\mathscr{T}$ is said to be strongly crepant.
Definition 4.1.3 Let $X$ be an algebraic variety with Gorenstein and rational singularities. let ${\pi}_{1}:\tilde{X}_{1}\rightarrow X$ be a resolution of singularities of $X$ and let $\delta_{1}:\mathscr{T}_{1}\hookrightarrow\mathrm{D^{b}}(\tilde{X}_{1})$ be a categorical resolutions of singularities of $X$. We say that $\mathscr{T}_{1}$ is weakly minimal if for any other resolution of singularities ${\pi}_{2}:\tilde{X}_{2}\rightarrow X$ with a morphism $\pi_{12}:\tilde{X}_{1}\rightarrow\tilde{X}_{2}$ and a commutative diagram: $\xymatrix{\mathrm{D^{b}}(\tilde{X}_{1})\ar[dd]^{{\pi_{1}}_{*}}\ar[rd]^{{\pi_{1% 2}}_{*}}&\\ &\mathrm{D^{b}}(\tilde{X}_{2})\ar[ld]^{{\pi_{2}}_{*}}\\ \mathrm{D^{b}}(X)&\\ }$ and any other categorical resolution $\delta_{2}:\mathscr{T}_{2}\hookrightarrow\mathrm{D^{b}}(\tilde{X}_{2})$ with a commutative diagram: $\xymatrix{\mathscr{T}_{1}\ar[dd]^{{\pi_{\mathscr{T}_{1}}}_{*}}\ar[rd]^{{{\pi_{% {\mathscr{T}_{1}},{\mathscr{T}_{2}}}}_{*}}}&\\ &\mathscr{T}_{2}\ar[ld]^{{\pi_{\mathscr{T}_{2}}}_{*}}\\ \mathrm{D^{b}}(X)&\\ }$ with ${\pi_{\mathscr{T}_{i}}}_{*}={\pi_{i}}_{*}\delta_{i}$, ${\pi_{{\mathscr{T}_{1}},{\mathscr{T}_{2}}}}_{*}=\delta_{2}^{!}{\pi_{12}}_{*}% \delta_{1}$ and such that $\mathscr{T}_{1}$ and $\mathscr{T}_{2}$ are $\mathrm{D^{perf}}(X)$-module categories, we have the implication: $\pi_{{\mathscr{T}_{1}},{\mathscr{T}_{2}}}^{*}\text{is fully faithful}\implies% \mathscr{T}_{1}=\mathscr{T}_{2}.$
Definition 3.2.1 Let $X$ be an algebraic variety and $L$ a line bundle on $X$. Let $\mathscr{T}\subset\mathrm{D^{b}}(X)$ be a full admissible subcategory such that for all $T\in\mathscr{T}$, we have $T\otimes L\in\mathscr{T}$. We say that $\mathscr{T}$ admits a dual Lefschetz decomposition with respect to $L$, if there exists a semi-orthogonal decomposition: $\mathscr{T}=\langle B_{m}\otimes L^{\otimes m},B_{m-1}\otimes L^{\otimes m-1},% \ldots,B_{0}\rangle,$ where $B_{m}\subset B_{m-1}\subset\ldots\subset B_{0}$ are full admissible subcategories of $\mathscr{T}$.
Definition 2.1.2 (Wonderful resolutions) Let $X$ be an algebraic variety with Gorenstein singularities. For all $n\geq 1$, we define a $n$-step wonderful resolution of singularities in the following recursive way: • A $1$-step wonderful resolution is a single blow up: $\pi:\tilde{X}\rightarrow X,$ over a smooth normally flat center $Y\subset X$, such that $\tilde{X}$ and the exceptional divisor $E\subset\tilde{X}$ are smooth. • For $n\geq 2$, a $n$-step wonderful resolution of X is a sequence of blow-ups: $X_{n}\stackrel{{\scriptstyle\pi_{n}}}{{\rightarrow}}X_{n-1}\ldots X_{1}% \stackrel{{\scriptstyle\pi_{1}}}{{\rightarrow}}X_{0}=X$ over smooth normally flat centers $Y_{k+1}\subset X_{k}$ such that: 1. all the $X_{k}$ are Gorenstein, 2. the map $\pi_{2}\ldots\pi_{n}:X_{n}\rightarrow X_{1}$ is a $(n-1)$-step wonderful resolution of $X_{1}$, 3. the intersection of $Y_{k+1}$ with $E^{(k)}_{1}$ is proper and smooth (where $E^{(k)}_{1}$ is the total transform of $E_{1}$, the exceptional divisor of $\pi_{1}$, with respect to $\pi_{2}\ldots\pi_{k}$, for $k>1$), 4. the map $\pi_{2}\ldots\pi_{n}|_{E^{(n)}_{1}}:E^{(n)}_{1}\longrightarrow E_{1}$ is a $(n-1)$-step wonderful resolution of singularities.

Definition 3.2. A gauge on a set $X$ is a nonempty set $\cG=\{d_{\alpha}\}$ of metrics on $X$, called gauge metrics or $X$-metrics, such that for any two gauge metrics $d_{1}$ and $d_{2}$, there exists a gauge metric $d_{3}$ with $d_{3}\geq d_{1}$ and $d_{3}\geq d_{2}$. A gauge space is a set $X$ equipped with a gauge \cG; we write it as $(X,\cG)$ or just $X$ if there is no danger of confusion.
Definition 9.1. A function $f:X\to Y$ between gauge spaces is uniformly continuous iff for any $Y$-metric $d_{Y}$ and $\ep>0$, there exists an $X$-metric $d_{X}$ and $\delta>0$ such that for all $x,x^{\prime}\in X$, we have $d_{X}(x,x^{\prime})<\delta\;\Longrightarrow\;d_{Y}(f(x),f(x^{\prime}))<\ep.$
Definition 3.1. A metric on a set $X$ is a function $d\colon X\times X\to[0,\infty)$ such that (i) $d(x,x)=0$ for each $x\in X$ (reflexivity). (ii) $d(x,y)=d(y,x)$ for each $x,y\in X$ (symmetry). (iii) $d(x,y)+d(y,z)\geq d(x,z)$ for each $x,y,z\in X$ (transitivity or the triangle inequality). A space equipped with a metric is called a metric space.
Definition 11.1. A Cauchy point of a gauge space $X$ consists of, for each gauge metric $d$, a function $\xi_{d}\colon X\to[0,\infty)$ such that (i) $d(x,y)+\xi_{d}(y)\geq\xi_{d}(x)$ for each $d$ and each $x,y\in X$, (ii) $\xi_{d}(x)+\xi_{d}(y)\geq d(x,y)$ for each $d$ and each $x,y\in X$, (iii) $\inf_{x\in X}\xi_{d}(x)=0$ for each $d$ (locatedness), and (iv) For any two gauge metrics $d_{1}$ and $d_{2}$, there exists a gauge metric $d_{3}$ such that $d_{3}\geq\max(d_{1},d_{2})$ and $\xi_{d_{3}}\geq\max(\xi_{d_{1}},\xi_{d_{2}})$.
Definition 4.1. For $d$ a metric on $X$ and nonempty subsets $A,B\subseteq X$ we define $d(A,B)=\inf_{a\in A,b\in B}d(a,b)$ For $x\in X$ we write $d(x,B)=d(\{x\},B)$ In a gauge space, we write $A\approx B$ if $d(A,B)=0$ for all gauge metrics $d$. By convention, we say $\emptyset\not\approx A$ for all sets $A$.
Definition 1.3. A function $\chi\colon\operatorname{\mathsf{Ob}}\nolimits{\mathsf{C}}\to{\mathbb{N}}$ is called cohomological provided that (1) $\chi(C\oplus C^{\prime})=\chi(C)+\chi(C^{\prime})$ for each pair of objects $C$ and $C^{\prime}$, (2) for each object $C$ there is some $n\in{\mathbb{Z}}$ such that $\chi(\Sigma^{n}C)=0$, and (3) for each exact triangle $A\to B\to C\to$ in ${\mathsf{C}}$ and each labelling $\cdots\to X_{-2}\to X_{-1}\to X_{0}\to X_{1}\to X_{2}\to\cdots$ of the induced sequence $\cdots\to\Sigma^{-1}B\to\Sigma^{-1}C\to A\to B\to C\to\Sigma A\to\Sigma B\to\cdots$ with $\chi(X_{0})=0$ we have $\sum_{i=0}^{n}(-1)^{i+n}\chi(X_{i})\geq 0\qquad\text{for all $n\in{\mathbb{Z}}$},$ and equality holds when $\chi(X_{n})=0$. If $(\chi_{i})_{i\in I}$ are cohomological functions and for any $C$ in ${\mathsf{C}}$ the set $\{i\in I\mid\chi_{i}(C)\neq 0\}$ is finite, then we can define the locally finite sum $\sum_{i\in I}\chi_{i}$. A non-zero cohomological function is irreducible if it cannot be written as a sum of two non-zero cohomological functions.
Definition 1.2. A cohomological functor $H\colon{\mathsf{C}}^{\mathrm{op}}\to\operatorname{\mathsf{Ab}}\nolimits$ is called endofinite1The term endofinite reflects condition (1), while (2) is added for technical reasons. provided that for each object $C$ (1) $H(C)$ has finite length as a module over the ring $\operatorname{\mathsf{End}}\nolimits(H)$, and (2) $H(\Sigma^{n}C)=0$ for some $n\in{\mathbb{Z}}$. If $(H_{i})_{i\in I}$ are cohomological functors, then the direct sum $\bigoplus_{i\in I}H_{i}$ is cohomological. A non-zero cohomological functor $H\colon{\mathsf{C}}^{\mathrm{op}}\to\operatorname{\mathsf{Ab}}\nolimits$ is indecomposable if it cannot be written as a direct sum of two non-zero cohomological functors.
Definition 2.1.

A filter on $X$ is a subset $\mathscr{F}$ of $P(X)$ such that: i. $\mathscr{F}$ is upwards closed: if $Z\subseteq Y\subseteq X$ with $Z\in\mathscr{F}$ then $Y\in\mathscr{F}$ ii. $\mathscr{F}$ is closed under finite intersections: $X\in\mathscr{F}$, and if $Y,Z\in\mathscr{F}$ then $Y\cap Z\in\mathscr{F}$.

Definition 2.2. Let $\mathcal{A}$ be an abelian category. (1) A kernel (or monomorphism) $k:K\to M$ in $\mathcal{A}$ is called fully invariant if for every morphism $h:M\to M$, $hk$ factors through $k$. A subobject $K$ of $M$ is called fully invariant if the inclusion monomorphism $k:K\to M$ is fully invariant. (2) A cokernel (or epimorphism) $c:M\to C$ in $\mathcal{A}$ is called fully coinvariant if for every morphism $h:M\to M$, $ch$ factors through $c$. A factor object $C$ of $M$ is called fully coinvariant if the natural epimorphism $c:M\to C$ is fully coinvariant.

Definition 2.6. An object $M$ of an abelian category $\mathcal{A}$ is called weak duo if every section $K\to M$ is fully invariant, or equivalently, every retraction $M\to C$ is fully coinvariant.
Definition 16. Let $\mathscr{C},\mathscr{D}$ be generalized categories, let $F,G:\mathscr{C}\to\mathscr{D}$. Let $(\theta_{1},\theta_{2}):F\Rightarrow G$ be a morphism of functors. We say that $(\theta_{1},\theta_{2})$ is natural or that $(\theta_{1},\theta_{2})$ is a natural transformation if, for every $a,b\in\mathscr{C}$, $\theta_{1}(a)=\theta_{1}(b)$ whenever $\hat{a}=\hat{b}$, and $\theta_{2}(a)=\theta_{2}(b)$ whenever $\bar{a}=\bar{b}$.
Definition 54. A sieve on a generalized category $\mathscr{C}$ is a subset $\mathscr{S}$ of $\mathscr{C}$ such that there exists $U\in\mathscr{C}$ such that for every $s\in\mathscr{S}$, $\hat{s}=U$. We say that $\mathscr{S}$ is a sieve at $U$. We write $\bar{\mathscr{S}}=U$.
