Definition 3.1. By a $\mathbf{k}$-linear category we mean a $\mathbf{k}$-module $\mathcal{C}$ which is equivalent to $\operatorname{RMod}_{A}(\mathbf{k})$ for some finite-dimensional $k$-algebra $A$. A $\mathbf{k}$-linear functor between two $\mathbf{k}$-linear categories is a right exact $\mathbf{k}$-module functor.
Definition 4.1 ([Ma, JS]). The center (or Drinfeld center or monoidal center) of a monoidal category $\mathcal{C}$, denoted by $\mathfrak{Z}(\mathcal{C})$, is the category of pairs $(Z,z)$, where $Z\in\mathcal{C}$ and $z$ is a half braiding for $Z$, that is, a natural isomorphism $z:Z\otimes(-)\to(-)\otimes Z$ such that $z_{1_{\mathcal{C}}}=\operatorname{Id}_{Z}$ and $z_{U\otimes V}=(\operatorname{Id}_{U}\otimes z_{V})\circ(z_{U}\otimes% \operatorname{Id}_{V})$ for all $U,V\in\mathcal{C}$. Morphisms in $\mathfrak{Z}(\mathcal{C})$ are morphisms between the first components preserving half-braidings.
Definition 2.7. Let $(\mathcal{D},S^{\prime})$ be a tame schemoid with the set $\{id_{x}\}_{x\in ob\mathcal{D}}/\sim_{S^{\prime}}$ finite. For a morphism $u:({\mathcal{C}},S)\to(\mathcal{D},S^{\prime})$ of schemoids and a functor $M\in{\mathcal{T}}^{({\mathcal{C}},S)}$, (relative) schemoid cohomology of $u$ with coefficients in $M$ is defined by $H^{*}(({\mathcal{C}},S)\stackrel{{\scriptstyle u}}{{\to}}(\mathcal{D},S^{% \prime});M)=H^{*}(u;M):=\text{Ext}_{{\mathcal{T}}^{(\mathcal{D},S)}}^{*}(% \underline{R},\text{Ran}_{u}M).$
Definition 2.3. Let $F,G:({\mathcal{C}},S)\to(\mathcal{D},S^{\prime})$ be morphisms between the schemoids $({\mathcal{C}},S)$ and $(\mathcal{D},S^{\prime})$ in $q\mathsf{ASmd}$. We write $H:F\Rightarrow G$ if $H$ is a morphism from $({\mathcal{C}},S)\times I$ to $(\mathcal{D},S^{\prime})$ in $q\mathsf{ASmd}$ with $H\circ\varepsilon_{0}=F$ and $H\circ\varepsilon_{1}=G$. Here $({\mathcal{C}},S)\times I$ denotes the product of the quasi-schemoids and $\varepsilon_{i}:({\mathcal{C}},S)\to({\mathcal{C}},S)\times I$ is the morphism of quasi-schemoids defined by $\varepsilon_{i}(a)=(a,i)$ for an object $a$ in ${\mathcal{C}}$ and $\varepsilon_{i}(f)=(f,1_{i})$ for a morphism $f$ in ${\mathcal{C}}$. We call the morphism $H$ above a homotopy from $F$ to $G$. A morphism $F$ is equivalent to $G$, denoted $F\sim G$, if there exists a homotopy from $F$ to $G$ or that from $G$ to $F$.
Definition 2.5. Schemoids $({\mathcal{C}},S_{{\mathcal{C}}})$ and $({\mathcal{C}}^{\prime},S_{{\mathcal{C}}^{\prime}})$ are Morita equivalent if the functor categories ${\mathcal{T}}^{({\mathcal{C}},S_{{\mathcal{C}}})}$ and $T^{({\mathcal{C}}^{\prime},S_{{\mathcal{C}}^{\prime}})}$ are equivalent as abelian categories.
Definition 3.8. Let ${\mathcal{C}}\hookrightarrow{\mathcal{D}}$ be the embedding of a subcategory $\cal C$ into a category $\cal D$. (a) An object $u\in{\mathcal{D}}$ is said to be $\mathcal{C}$-homogeneous if for every objects $a,b\in{\mathcal{C}}$ and arrows $j:a\rightarrow b$ in ${\mathcal{C}}$ and $\chi:a\rightarrow u$ in $\mathcal{D}$ there exists an arrow $\tilde{\chi}:b\rightarrow u$ in $\mathcal{D}$ such that $\tilde{\chi}\circ j=\chi$: $\xymatrix{a\ar[d]_{j}\ar[r]^{\chi}&u\\ b\ar@{-->}[ur]_{\tilde{\chi}}&}$ (b) An object $u\in{\mathcal{D}}$ is said to be $\mathcal{C}$-ultrahomogeneous if for every objects $a,b\in{\mathcal{C}}$ and arrows $j:a\rightarrow b$ in ${\mathcal{C}}$ and $\chi_{1}:a\rightarrow u$, $\chi_{2}:b\rightarrow u$ in $\mathcal{D}$ there exists an isomorphism $\check{j}:u\rightarrow u$ such that $\check{j}\circ\chi_{1}=\chi_{2}\circ j$: $\xymatrix{a\ar[d]_{j}\ar[r]^{\chi_{1}}&u\ar@{-->}[d]^{\check{j}}\\ b\ar[r]_{\chi_{2}}&u}$ (c) An object $u\in{\mathcal{D}}$ is said to be $\mathcal{C}$-universal if it is $\mathcal{C}$-cofinal, that is for every $a\in{\mathcal{C}}$ there exists an arrow $\chi:a\rightarrow u$ in $\mathcal{D}$: $\xymatrix{a\ar@{-->}[r]^{\chi}&u}$
Definition 3.2. Let $\mathbb{T}$ be a geometric theory over a signature $\Sigma$. A geometric formula-in-context $\{\vec{x}.\phi\}$ is said to be $\mathbb{T}$-irreducible if for any family $\{\theta_{i}\mid i\in I\}$ of $\mathbb{T}$-provably functional geometric formulae $\{\vec{x_{i}},\vec{x}.\theta_{i}\}$ from $\{\vec{x_{i}}.\phi_{i}\}$ to $\{\vec{x}.\phi\}$ such that $(\phi\vdash_{\vec{x}}\mathbin{\mathop{\textrm{\huge$\vee$}}\limits_{i\in I}}(% \exists\vec{x_{i}})\theta_{i})$ is provable in $\mathbb{T}$, there exist $i\in I$ and a $\mathbb{T}$-provably functional geometric formula $\{\vec{x},\vec{x_{i}}.\theta^{\prime}\}$ from $\{\vec{x}.\phi\}$ to $\{\vec{x_{i}}.\phi_{i}\}$ such that $(\phi\vdash_{\vec{x}}(\exists\vec{x_{i}})(\theta^{\prime}\wedge\theta_{i}))$ is provable in $\mathbb{T}$.
Definition 3.6. A category $\mathcal{C}$ is said to satisfy the amalgamation property (AP) if for every objects $a,b,c\in{\mathcal{C}}$ and morphisms $f:a\rightarrow b$, $g:a\rightarrow c$ in $\mathcal{C}$ there exists an object $d\in\mathcal{C}$ and morphisms $f^{\prime}:b\rightarrow d$, $g^{\prime}:c\rightarrow d$ in $\mathcal{C}$ such that $f^{\prime}\circ f=g^{\prime}\circ g$: $\xymatrix{a\ar[d]_{g}\ar[r]^{f}&b\ar@{-->}[d]^{f^{\prime}}\\ c\ar@{-->}[r]_{g^{\prime}}&d}$
Definition 3.1. Let $\mathbb{T}$ be a geometric theory over a signature $\Sigma$ and $M$ a set-based $\mathbb{T}$-model. Then (a) The model $M$ is said to be finitely presentable if the representable functor $\textrm{Hom}_{{\mathbb{T}}\textrm{-mod}({\bf Set})}(M,-):{\mathbb{T}}\textrm{-% mod}({\bf Set})\to{\bf Set}$ preserves filtered colimits; (b) The model $M$ is said to be finitely presented if there is a geometric formula $\{\vec{x}.\phi\}$ over $\Sigma$ and a string of elements $(\xi_{1},\ldots,\xi_{n})\in MA_{1}\times\cdots\times MA_{n}$ (where $A_{1},\ldots,A_{n}$ are the sorts of the variables in $\vec{x}$), called the generators of $M$, such that for any $\mathbb{T}$-model $N$ in ${\bf Set}$ and string of elements $(b_{1},\ldots,b_{n})\in MA_{1}\times\cdots\times MA_{n}$ such that $(b_{1},\ldots,b_{n})\in[[\vec{x}.\phi]]_{N}$, there exists a unique arrow $f:M\to N$ in ${\mathbb{T}}\textrm{-mod}({\bf Set})$ such that $(fA_{1}\times\ldots\times fA_{n})((\xi_{1},\ldots,\xi_{n}))=(b_{1},\ldots,b_{n})$.
Definition 3.7. A category $\mathcal{C}$ is said to satisfy the joint embedding property (JEP) if for every pair of objects $a,b\in{\mathcal{C}}$ there exists an object $c\in\mathcal{C}$ and morphisms $f:a\rightarrow c$, $g:b\rightarrow c$ in $\mathcal{C}$: $\xymatrix{&a\ar@{-->}[d]^{f}\\ b\ar@{-->}[r]_{g}&c}$
Definition 3.15. Let $\mathbb{T}$ be a geometric theory over a signature $\Sigma$. The injectivization ${\mathbb{T}}_{i}$ of $\mathbb{T}$ is the geometric theory obtained from $\mathbb{T}$ by adding a binary predicate $D_{A}\rightarrowtail A,A$ for each sort $A$ over $\Sigma$ and the coherent sequents $(D_{A}(x^{A},y^{A})\wedge x^{A}=y^{A})\vdash_{x^{A},y^{A}}\bot)$ and $(\top\vdash_{x^{A},y^{A}}D_{A}(x^{A},y^{A})\vee x^{A}=y^{A}).$
5.2 Definition. Let $X$ be a weak transition system and let $0$ be a state of $X$. A state $\alpha$ of $X$ is reachable from $0$ if it is equal to $0$ or if there exists a finite sequence of transitions $t_{i}$ of $X$ from $\alpha_{i}$ to $\alpha_{i+1}$ for $0\leqslant i\leqslant n$ with $n\geqslant 0$, $\alpha_{0}=i$ and $\alpha_{n+1}=\alpha$.
2.6 Definition. Let $V$ be the weak transition system defined as follows: • The set of states is $\{0,1\}$. • The set of actions is $\Sigma\times\{0,1\}$. • The labelling map is the projection $\Sigma\times\{0,1\}\to\Sigma$. • The transitions are the tuples $(\epsilon_{0},(x_{1},\epsilon_{1}),\dots,(x_{n},\epsilon_{n}),\epsilon_{n+1})$ for all $\epsilon_{0},\dots,\epsilon_{n+1}\in\{0,1\}$ and all $x_{1},\dots,x_{n}\in\Sigma$.
2.2 Definition. A weak transition system consists of a triple $X=(S,\mu:L\rightarrow\Sigma,T=\bigcup_{n\geqslant 1}T_{n})$ where $S$ is a set of states, where $L$ is a set of actions, where $\mu:L\rightarrow\Sigma$ is a set map called the labelling map, and finally where $T_{n}\subset S\times L^{n}\times S$ for $n\geqslant 1$ is a set of $n$-transitions or $n$-dimensional transitions such that one has: • (Multiset axiom) For every permutation $\sigma$ of $\{1,\dots,n\}$ with $n\geqslant 2$, if the tuple $(\alpha,u_{1},\dots,u_{n},\beta)$ is a transition, then the tuple $(\alpha,u_{\sigma(1)},\dots,u_{\sigma(n)},\beta)$ is a transition as well. • (Patching axiom 1This axiom is called the Coherence axiom in [Gau10] and [Gau11], and the composition axiom in [Gau15b]. I definitively adopted the terminology “patching axiom” after reading the Web page in nLab devoted to higher dimensional transition systems and written by Tim Porter.) For every $(n+2)$-tuple $(\alpha,u_{1},\dots,u_{n},\beta)$ with $n\geqslant 3$, for every $p,q\geqslant 1$ with $p+q<n$, if the five tuples $(\alpha,u_{1},\dots,u_{n},\beta)$, $(\alpha,u_{1},\dots,u_{p},\nu_{1})$, $(\nu_{1},u_{p+1},\dots,u_{n},\beta)$, $(\alpha,u_{1},\dots,u_{p+q},\nu_{2})$ and $(\nu_{2},u_{p+q+1},\dots,u_{n},\beta)$ are transitions, then the $(q+2)$-tuple $(\nu_{1},u_{p+1},\dots,u_{p+q},\nu_{2})$ is a transition as well. A map of weak transition systems $f:(S,\mu:L\rightarrow\Sigma,(T_{n})_{n\geqslant 1})\rightarrow(S^{\prime},\mu^% {\prime}:L^{\prime}\rightarrow\Sigma,(T^{\prime}_{n})_{n\geqslant 1})$ consists of a set map $f_{0}:S\rightarrow S^{\prime}$, a commutative square $\xymatrix{L\ar@{->}[r]^{-}{\mu}\ar@{->}[d]_{-}{\widetilde{f}}&\Sigma\ar@{=}[d]% \\ L^{\prime}\ar@{->}[r]_{-}{\mu^{\prime}}&\Sigma}$ such that if $(\alpha,u_{1},\dots,u_{n},\beta)$ is a transition, then $(f_{0}(\alpha),\widetilde{f}(u_{1}),\dots,\widetilde{f}(u_{n}),f_{0}(\beta))$ is a transition. The corresponding category is denoted by $\mathcal{W\!T\!S}$. The $n$-transition $(\alpha,u_{1},\dots,u_{n},\beta)$ is also called a transition from $\alpha$ to $\beta$. The maps $f_{0}$ and $\widetilde{f}$ will be also denoted by $f$.
2.11 Definition. Let $X=(S,\mu:L\to\Sigma,T)$ be a weak transition systems. Let $\operatorname{{Path}}(X)$ be the weak transition system defined as follows: • The set of states is the set $S\times S$. • The set of actions is the set $L\times_{\Sigma}L$ and the labelling map is the canonical map $L\times_{\Sigma}L\to\Sigma$. • The transitions are the tuples $((\alpha^{0},\alpha^{1}),(u_{1}^{0},u_{1}^{1}),\dots,(u_{n}^{0},u_{n}^{1}),(% \beta^{0},\beta^{1}))$ such that for any $\epsilon_{0},\dots,\epsilon_{n+1}\in\{0,1\}$, the tuple $(\alpha^{\epsilon_{0}},u_{1}^{\epsilon_{1}},\dots,u_{n}^{\epsilon_{n}},\beta^{% \epsilon_{n+1}})$ is a transition of $X$. Let $f:X\to Y$ be a map of weak transition systems. The map of weak transition systems $\operatorname{{Path}}(f):\operatorname{{Path}}(X)\to\operatorname{{Path}}(Y)$ is defined on states by the mapping $(\alpha,\epsilon)\mapsto(f(\alpha),\epsilon)$ and on actions by the mapping $(u,\epsilon)\mapsto(f(u),\epsilon)$.
5.3 Definition. A reachable weak (cubical regular resp.) transition system is an object $i\rightarrow X$ of the comma category $i{\downarrow}\mathcal{K}$ such that every state of the underlying weak transition system $X$ is reachable from $i$. The full subcategory of $i{\downarrow}\mathcal{K}$ of reachable weak (cubical regular resp.) transition systems is denoted by $\mathcal{K}_{\bullet}$.
3.6 Definition. Let $X$ be a weak transition system. A state $\alpha$ of $X$ is internal if there exists three transitions $(\gamma,u_{1},\dots,u_{n},\delta)$, $(\gamma,u_{1},\dots,u_{p},\alpha)$ and $(\alpha,u_{p+1},\dots,u_{n},\delta)$ with $n\geqslant 2$ and $p\geqslant 1$.
Definition 2.1. Let $X$ be a locale and $F$ a sheaf on $X$. $F$ is called a partially ordered sheaf (shortly posheaf) if and only if $F$ satisfies the following conditions: (POS1) $F(u)$ is a partially ordered set for every $u\in\mathcal{O}(X)$; (POS2) every restriction map $F(u)\rightarrow F(v)$ for $v\leq u$ is order-preserving; (POS3) given two compatible families $\{s_{i}\in F(u_{i})\mid i\in I\}$ and $\{t_{i}\in F(u_{i})\mid i\in I\}$ with $s_{i}\leq t_{i}$ for any $i\in I$. If $\{s_{i}\in F(u_{i})\mid i\in I\}$ patch to an element $s\in F(\bigvee u_{i})$ and $\{t_{i}\in F(u_{i})\mid i\in I\}$ patch to another element $t\in F(\bigvee u_{i})$, then $s\leq t$.
Definition 3.3.1. A preseparative algebra $\underline{X}=(X,.,+)$ is called a separative algebra if the following axiom is satisfied: $(Sep_{\,0})$ The relation $\leq$ is transitive. A separative algebra X is called a convex space if the operations $``."$ and $``+"$ coincide. In this case the filters and the ideals are called convex sets and the prime filters correspond to the notion of half-space.
Definition 2.3.1. Let $(S,{\cal T}^{+},{\cal T}^{-})$ be an abstract spectrum. For every two points $a,b\in S$ we put $a\leq b$ iff $cl_{(S,{\cal T}^{-})}\{a\}\subseteq cl_{(S,{\cal T}^{-})}\{b\}$ (i.e., $a\leq b$ iff $a$ is a specialization of $b$ in the topological space $(S,{\cal T}^{-})$).
Definition 2.1.3. A non-empty bitopological space $(S,{\cal T}^{+},{\cal T}^{-})$ is called an abstract spectrum, if it has the following properties: (SP1) ${\cal L}^{+}$ is a base for ${\cal T}^{+}$ and ${\cal L}^{-}$ is a base for ${\cal T}^{-}$; (SP2) if $F\subseteq S$ and $S\setminus F\in{\cal T}^{+}$ (resp. $S\setminus F\in{\cal T}^{-}$) then $F$ is a compact subset of the topological space $(S,{\cal T}^{-})$ (resp. $(S,{\cal T}^{+})$); (SP3) at least one of the topological spaces $(S,{\cal T}^{+})$ and $(S,{\cal T}^{-})$ is a $T_{0}$-space.
Definition 3.7.1. We shall say that a preseparative algebra $\underline{X}=(X,.,+)$ is topological, if $X$ is endowed with a topology such that the mappings $a.x$ and $a+x$ are lower semi-continuous, i.e., for every $a\in X$, the multi-valued maps $\varphi_{a}:X\longrightarrow X,\ \ x\mapsto a+x,\ \ \mbox{ and }\ \ \psi_{a}:X% \longrightarrow X,\ \ x\mapsto a.x,$ are lower semi-continuous. Recall that a multi-valued map $f:X\longrightarrow Y$ between two topological spaces $X$ and $Y$ is said to be lower semi-continuous if, for every open subset $U$ of $Y$, the set $f^{-1}(U)$ is open in $X$ (here, as usual, $f^{-1}(U)=\{x\in X:\ f(x)\cap U\not=\emptyset\});$ equivalently, $f$ is lower semi-continuous if, for every $x_{0}\in X$ and every open subset $U$ of $Y$ with $U\cap f(x_{0})\not=\emptyset$, there exists a neighborhood $V$ of $x_{0}$ in $X$ such that $U\cap f(x)\not=\emptyset$, for every $x\in V$. For $a+x$, for example, this means that if $a,b\in X$ and $U$ is an open set with $(a+b)\cap U\not=\emptyset$, then there exists a neighborhood $V$ of $b$ such that $(a+x)\cap U\not=\emptyset$, for each $x\in V$. A topological preseparative algebra will be called a separative space if, for each open filter $U$ in $X$, the conditions $\alpha(a)\cap U\not=\emptyset$ and $b\in\mu(a)$ imply $\alpha(b)\cap U\not=\emptyset$. A separative space $\underline{X}=(X,.,+)$ is called a topological convex space if the operations $``."$ and $``+"$ in $X$ coincide (see [2], [3]).
Definition 3.1.1. The system $\underline{X}=(X,.,+)$ is called a preseparative algebra if $X\not=\emptyset$, $``."$ and $``+"$ are binary multivalued operations in X satisfying the following axioms: for arbitrary $a,b,c,x\in X$, (i) $ab=ba$, (i’) $a+b=b+a$, (ii) $a(bc)=(ab)c$, (ii’) $a+(b+c)=(a+b)+c$, (iii) from $a\in b+x$, and $c\in dx$, it follows that $(ad)\cap(b+c)\not=\emptyset$.
Definition 2.1.9. An abstract spectrum $(S,{\cal T}^{+},{\cal T}^{-})$ is called a Stone spectrum if the topologies ${\cal T}^{+}$ and ${\cal T}^{-}$ coincide.
Definition 3.2.1. Let $\underline{X}=(X,.,+)$ be a preseparative algebra. A subset $F\subseteq X$ is called a filter in $X$ if $F.F\subseteq F$. A subset $I\subseteq X$ is called an ideal in $X$ if $I+I\subseteq I$. A subset $F\subseteq X$ is called a prime filter in $X$ if $F$ is a filter and the complement $X\setminus F$ of $F$ is an ideal in $X$. Dually, a subset $I\subseteq X$ is called a prime ideal in $X$ if $I$ is an ideal and $X\setminus I$ is a filter in $X$.
Definition 2.2.7. Let $X$ be a set endowed with two arbitrary single-valued binary operations $+$ and $\times$. Let’s call a subset $p$ of $X$ an l-prime ideal in $(X,+,\times)$ if the following two conditions are fulfilled: i) $x+y\in p$ iff $x\in p$ and $y\in p$; ii) $x\times y\in p$ iff $x\in p$ or $y\in p$. Let us fix two different points $0$ and $1$ of $X$. We shall say that an l-prime ideal $p\subseteq X$ is proper (or, more precisely, proper with respect to the points $0$ and $1$), if $0\in p$ and $1\not\in p$.
Definition 2.1.8. Let $(S_{1},{\cal T}^{+}_{1},{\cal T}^{-}_{1})$ and $(S_{2},{\cal T}^{+}_{2},{\cal T}^{-}_{2})$ be abstract spectra. Then a function $f\in\mbox{{\boldmath$Set$}}(S_{1},S_{2})$ is called an $\SS$-morphism if $f:(S_{1},{\cal T}^{+}_{1})\longrightarrow(S_{2},{\cal T}^{+}_{2})$ and $f:(S_{1},{\cal T}^{-}_{1})\longrightarrow(S_{2},{\cal T}^{-}_{2})$ are continuous maps. The class of all abstract spectra together with the class of all $\SS$-morphisms and the natural composition between them form, obviously, a category which will be denoted by $\SS$ and will be called the category of abstract spectra.
Definition 2.2.3. Let $X$ be a set endowed with two arbitrary multivalued binary operations $\oplus$ and $\otimes$. Let’s call a subset $p$ of $X$ a prime ideal in $(X,\oplus,\otimes)$ if the following two conditions are fulfilled: i) if $x,y\in p$ then $x\oplus y\subseteq p$; ii) if $(x\otimes y)\cap p\not=\emptyset$ then $x\in p$ or $y\in p$. Let us fix two different points $0$ and $1$ of $X$. We shall say that a prime ideal $p\subseteq X$ is proper (or, more precisely, proper with respect to the points $0$ and $1$), if $0\in p$ and $1\not\in p$. A subset $q$ of $X$ is called a prime (proper) flter in $(X,\oplus,\otimes)$ if the set $X\setminus q$ is a prime (proper) ideal.
Definition 3.4.1. Let $\underline{X}=(X,.,+)$ be a preseparative algebra. The following statement is called the Separation principle for $X$: (Sep) If $F_{0}$ is a filter, $I_{0}$ is an ideal and $F_{0}\cap I_{0}=\emptyset$ then there exist a prime filter $F$ and a prime ideal $I$ such that $F_{0}\subseteq F$, $I_{0}\subseteq I$ and $F\cap I=\emptyset$.
Definition 2.3.9. (see, for example, [27]) Let $(X,{\cal T})$ be a topological space. (a) We shall denote by $KO(X,{\cal T})$ (or, simply, by $KO(X)$) the family of all compact open subsets of $X$. (b) A closed subset $F$ of $X$ is called irreducible if the equality $F=F_{1}\cup F_{2}$, where $F_{1}$ and $F_{2}$ are closed subsets of $X$, implies that $F=F_{1}$ or $F=F_{2}$. (c) We say that the space $(X,{\cal T})$ is sober if it is a $T_{0}$-space and for every non-void irreducible subset $F$ of $X$ there exists a $x\in X$ such that $F=cl_{X}\{x\}$. (d) The space $(X,{\cal T})$ is called coherent if it is a compact sober space and the family $KO(X,{\cal T})$ is a closed under finite intersections base for the topology ${\cal T}$. (e) A continuous map $f:(X^{\prime},{\cal T}^{\prime})\longrightarrow(X^{\prime\prime},{\cal T}^{% \prime\prime})$ is called coherent if $U^{\prime\prime}\in KO(X^{\prime\prime})$ implies that $f^{-1}(U^{\prime\prime})\in KO(X^{\prime})$.
Definition 1.1. A bicategory $\mathcal{B}$ is specified by the following data: $\circ$ a class $\mathrm{Ob}\left(\mathcal{B}\right)$ of objects; $\circ$ for each pair $A,B\in\mathrm{Ob}\left(\mathcal{B}\right)$, a category $\mathcal{B}\left(A,B\right)$ whose objects are called 1-morphisms and whose morphisms are called 2-morphisms; we write $\alpha\odot\beta$ for the composite of the 2-morphisms $\alpha,\beta$; $\circ$ for each triple of objects $A,B,C\in\mathrm{Ob}\left(\mathcal{B}\right)$, a composition law given by a functor $c_{ABC}\colon\mathcal{B}\left(A,B\right)\times\mathcal{B}\left(B,C\right)\to% \mathcal{B}\left(A,C\right);$ given 1-morphisms $f\colon A\to B$, $g\colon B\to C$ of the bicategory $\mathcal{B}$, we write $g\circ f$ for their composite $c_{ABC}\left(f,g\right)$; given other 1-morphisms $f^{\prime}\colon A\to B$, $g^{\prime}\colon B\to C$ and 2-morphisms $\gamma\colon f\Rightarrow f^{\prime}$, $\delta\colon g\Rightarrow g^{\prime}$, we write $\delta\ast\gamma$ for their composite $c_{ABC}\left(\gamma,\delta\right)$; $\circ$ for each $A\in\mathrm{Ob}\left(\mathcal{B}\right)$, there is a functor $\upsilon_{A}\colon\mathbf{1}\to\mathcal{B}\left(A,A\right)$, where $\mathbf{1}$ is the terminal objects of the category of small categories. The identity 1-morphism $1_{A}\colon A\to A$ is the image of the unique object of $\mathbf{1}$ under the functor $\upsilon_{A}$; we write $\iota_{A}$ for the identity 2-morphisms on $1_{A}$ and $\iota_{f}$ for the identity 2-endomorphism of a 1-morphism $f\colon A\to B$; $\circ$ for each quadruple $A,B,C,D\in\mathrm{Ob}\left(\mathcal{B}\right)$, a natural isomorphism $\alpha_{ABCD}\colon c_{ABD}\circ\left(1\times c_{BCD}\right)\Rightarrow c_{ACD% }\circ\left(c_{ABC}\times 1\right)$ which is called the associativity isomorphism; $\circ$ for each pair $A,B\in\mathrm{Ob}\left(\mathcal{B}\right)$, two natural isomorphisms $\begin{split}\displaystyle\lambda_{AB}&\displaystyle\colon c_{AAB}\circ\left(% \upsilon_{A}\times 1\right)\Rightarrow 1\\ \displaystyle\rho_{AB}&\displaystyle\colon c_{ABB}\circ\left(1\times\upsilon_{% B}\right)\Rightarrow 1\end{split}$ which are called the left and right unit isomorphisms resp.; satisfying 1. Associativity coherence: given objects $A,B,C,D,E\in\mathrm{Ob}\left(\mathcal{B}\right)$ and 1-morphisms
Definition 2.2. Let $G_{1}$ and $G_{2}$ be (possibly infinite) graphs. $G_{1}$ and $G_{2}$ are said to be chromatically equivalent if $\underline{\chi}(G_{1},\bullet)\simeq\underline{\chi}(G_{2},\bullet).$
Definition 3.4. The natural tree $T_{\mathbb{N}}=(V,E)$ (Figure 1) is defined by • $V=\mathbb{N}=\{0,1,2,\dots,n,\dots\}$, and • $E=\{\{n,n+1\}\mid n\in\mathbb{N}\}$.
Definition 2.4. $\Pi=\{\pi_{\lambda}\mid\lambda\in\Lambda\}$ is called a stable partition of $G$ if • $\bigsqcup\Pi:=\bigsqcup_{\lambda\in\Lambda}\pi_{\lambda}=V$, and • $\{v_{1},v_{2}\}\in E,v_{1}\in\pi_{\lambda_{1}},v_{2}\in\pi_{\lambda_{2}}% \Longrightarrow\pi_{\lambda_{1}}\neq\pi_{\lambda_{2}}$. (In other words, $v_{1},v_{2}\in\pi_{\lambda}\Longrightarrow\{v_{1},v_{2}\}\notin E$.)
Definition 3.8. The natural wheel $W_{\mathbb{N}}=(V,E)$ (Figure 2) is defined by • $V=\mathbb{N}=\{0,1,2,\dots,n,\dots\}$, and • $E=\{\{0,n\}\mid n>0\}$.
Definition 2.7. An $R$-module $T$ is said to be 1-tilting if • $\operatorname*{pd}T\leq 1$, • $\operatorname*{Ext}_{R}^{1}(T,T^{(X)})=0$ for any set $X$, • there is an exact sequence $0\rightarrow R\rightarrow T_{0}\rightarrow T_{1}\rightarrow 0$, where $T_{i}$ is a direct summand of a direct sum of copies of $T$ for each $i=0,1$. The class $\mathcal{T}=T^{\perp}$ is called a 1-tilting class, and the induced cotorsion pair $(\mathcal{A},\mathcal{T})$ a 1-tilting cotorsion pair. Two 1-tilting modules $T$ and $T^{\prime}$ are said to be equivalent if $T^{\perp}=T^{\prime\perp}$.
Definition 2.2. A filter $\mathcal{G}$ of right ideals of $R$ is called a Gabriel topology provided that: • if $I\in\mathcal{G}$ and $t\in R$, then $(I:t)\in\mathcal{G}$, • if $J$ is a right ideal and $I\in\mathcal{G}$ is such that $(J:t)\in\mathcal{G}$ for any $t\in I$, then $J\in\mathcal{G}$. A Gabriel topology is finitely generated if it has a basis of finitely generated right ideals. A right ideal $I$ of $R$ is faithful if $\operatorname*{Ann}I=0$ (if $R$ is commutative, this is equivalent to $\operatorname*{Hom}_{R}(R/I,R)=0$). Say that a Gabriel topology is faithful if it has a basis consisting of faithful ideals (and thus all ideals in $\mathcal{G}$ are faithful).
Definition 3.7. Given a class $\mathcal{C}$ of modules, let $\operatorname*{SubLim}(\mathcal{C})$ denote the smallest (isomorphism-closed) subclass of $\operatorname*{Mod-R}$ containing $\mathcal{C}$ closed under direct limits and submodules. We say that a prime $\mathfrak{p}$ is vaguely associated to a module $M$ if $R/\mathfrak{p}$ is contained in $\operatorname*{SubLim}(\{M\})$. Denote the set of all vaguely associated primes of $M$ by $\operatorname*{VAss}M$.
Definition 5.3. We say that a tilting module $T$ arises from a perfect localization, if there is an faithful perfect localization $R\xhookrightarrow{}S$ such that $S\oplus S/R$ is a 1-tilting module equivalent to $T$.
Definition 2.12. A $1$-cotilting class $\mathcal{C}$ is of cofinite type provided there is a set of finitely presented modules $\mathcal{S}$ of projective dimension at most $1$ such that $\mathcal{C}=\mathcal{S}^{\intercal}$.
Definition 2.11. An $R$-module $C$ is said to be 1-cotilting if • $\operatorname*{id}C\leq 1$, • $\operatorname*{Ext}_{R}^{1}(C^{X},C)=0$ for any set $X$, • there is an exact sequence $0\rightarrow C_{1}\rightarrow C_{0}\rightarrow W\rightarrow 0$, where $W$ is an injective cogenerator in $\operatorname*{Mod-R}$, and $C_{i}$ is a direct summand of a direct product of copies of $C$ for each $i=0,1$. The class $\mathcal{C}={}^{\perp}C$ is called a 1-cotilting class induced by C and 1-cotilting modules $C,C^{\prime}$ are said to be equivalent if their induced cotilting classes coincide.
Definition 4.1. Let $R$ be a commutative ring, and let $\mathcal{I}$ be a set of faithful finitely generated ideals of $R$. For each $I\in\mathcal{I}$ fix a finite set of generators $\{x^{I}_{1},x^{I}_{2},\ldots,x^{I}_{n_{I}}\}$ of $I$. Let $\Lambda$ denote the set consisting of all finite sequences of pairs of the form $(I,k)$, where $I\in\mathcal{I}$, and $k<n_{I}$ (including the empty sequence denoted by $w$). Let $F$ be a free $R$-module with the basis $\Lambda$. Given two sequences $\lambda,\lambda^{\prime}\in\Lambda$, we denote their concatenation by $\lambda\sqcup\lambda^{\prime}$. In particular, symbol $\lambda\sqcup(I,k)$ will stand for appending pair $(I,k)$ to sequence $\lambda\in\Lambda$. Define a submodule $G$ of $F$ as the span of all elements of the form $\lambda-\sum_{k\in n_{I}}x^{I}_{k}(\lambda\sqcup(I,k)),$ for each $\lambda\in\Lambda$ and $I\in\mathcal{I}$. Put $M_{\mathcal{I}}=F/G$. Let us call the module $\delta_{\mathcal{I}}=M_{\mathcal{I}}\oplus M_{\mathcal{I}}/\operatorname*{Span% }(w)$ the Fuchs-Salce tilting module. If $\mathcal{G}$ is a faithful finitely generated Gabriel topology, we will abuse the notation by writing $\delta_{\mathcal{G}}$ instead of $\delta_{\mathcal{I}}$, where $\mathcal{I}$ is the set of all finitely generated ideals from $\mathcal{G}$.
Definition 3.1. Let $R$ be a ring and $M$ a left $R$-module. Let $P_{1}\xrightarrow{f}P_{0}\rightarrow M\rightarrow 0$ be a projective presentation of $M$. We use the notation $(-)^{*}$ for the regular module duality functor $\operatorname*{Hom}_{R}(-,R)$. The (Auslander-Bridger) transpose of $M$ is obtained as the cokernel of the map of right $R$-modules $f^{*}:P_{0}^{*}\rightarrow P_{1}^{*}$. We denote the transpose by $\operatorname*{Tr}M$.
Definition 1.1 (Cf. [MNNa, Def. LABEL:Fnildef]). Let $\mathscr{F}^{\textrm{Nil}}$, the $\infty$-category of $\mathscr{F}$-nilpotent $G$-spectra, be the smallest thick $\otimes$-ideal in $\mathrm{Sp}_{G}$ containing $\{G/H_{+}\}_{H\in\mathscr{F}}$. In other words, $\mathscr{F}^{\textrm{Nil}}$ is the smallest subcategory of $\mathrm{Sp}_{G}$ such that: (1) For each subgroup $H\in\mathscr{F}$, the suspension $G$-spectrum $G/H_{+}$ is $\mathscr{F}$-nilpotent. (2) For $E,F\in\mathrm{Sp}_{G}$ and $f\in\mathrm{Sp}_{G}(E,F)$, let $Cf$ denote the cofiber of $f$. If any two of $\{E,F,Cf\}$ are $\mathscr{F}$-nilpotent, then all three of them are $\mathscr{F}$-nilpotent. (3) If $E\in\mathrm{Sp}_{G}$ is a retract of an $\mathscr{F}$-nilpotent $G$-spectrum, then $E$ is $\mathscr{F}$-nilpotent. (4) If $E\in\mathrm{Sp}_{G}$ and $F$ is $\mathscr{F}$-nilpotent, then $E\wedge F$ is $\mathscr{F}$-nilpotent. Let $\mathscr{F}_{1}$ and $\mathscr{F}_{2}$ be two families of subgroups of $G$ and let $\mathscr{F}_{1}\cap\mathscr{F}_{2}$ denote their intersection. Then $\mathscr{F}_{1}^{\mathrm{Nil}}\cap\mathscr{F}_{2}^{\mathrm{Nil}}=(\mathscr{F}_% {1}\cap\mathscr{F}_{2})^{\mathrm{Nil}}$ by [MNNa, Prop. LABEL:fnilintersect]. For any $G$-spectrum $M$, there is thus a minimal family $\mathscr{F}$ such that $M$ is $\mathscr{F}$-nilpotent; we will call this minimal family the derived defect base of $M$.
Definition 2.1. For a finite-dimensional orthogonal representation $V$ of $G$, we let $nV$ denote $V^{\oplus n}$. We let $S(V)$ denote the unit $G$-sphere of $V$ and $S^{V}$ denote the pointed $G$-space obtained as the one-point compactification of $V$, where we take the point at $\infty$ to be the base point. Finally, we let $e_{V}$, the Euler class of $V$, denote the pointed $G$-map $e_{V}\colon S^{0}\rightarrow S^{V}$ induced by the inclusion $0\rightarrow V$.
Definition 2.2. Let $M$ be a $G$-spectrum. The $\mathscr{F}$-homotopy limit spectral sequence associated to $M$ is the homotopy spectral spectral sequence associated to the tower $\{F(\mathrm{sk}_{n}E\mathscr{F}_{+},M)\}_{n\geq 0},$ where $E\mathscr{F}$ is equipped with the simplicial structure of (2.8).
Definition 2.6. An ordered functor between locally inductive groupoids is said to be locally inductive whenever it preserves all meets that exist. In particular, a locally inductive functor will preserve empty meets and thus top elements and there is no requirement to define so-called “top-heavy locally inductive functors”.
Definition 1.11. A restriction structure on a category $\mathbf{X}$ is an assignment of an arrow $\overline{f_{A}}:A\rightarrow A$ to each arrow $f:A\rightarrow B$ in $\mathbf{X}$ satisfying the following four conditions: (R.1) For all maps $f,$ $f\,\overline{f_{A}}=f.$ (R.2) For all maps $f:A\rightarrow B$ and $g:A\rightarrow B^{\prime},$ $\overline{f_{A}}\,\overline{g_{A}}=\overline{g_{A}}\,\overline{f_{A}}.$ (R.3) For all maps $f:A\rightarrow B$ and $g:A\rightarrow B^{\prime},$ $\overline{g_{A}\,\overline{f_{A}}}=\overline{g_{A}}\,\overline{f_{A}}.$ (R.4) For all maps $f:B\rightarrow A$ and $g:A\rightarrow B^{\prime},$ $\overline{g_{A}}\,f=f\,\overline{(gf)_{B}}.$ A category equipped with a restriction structure is called a restriction category.
Definition 1.18. A map $f$ in a restriction category $\mathbf{X}$ is called a restricted isomorphism whenever there exists a map $g$ – called a restricted inverse of $f$ – such that $gf=\overline{f}$ and $fg=\overline{g}.$
Definition 2.18. An oplax functor $F:\mathbf{X}\rightarrow\mathbf{X^{\prime}}$ of inverse categories consists of the following data: • for each object $A\in\mathbf{X},$ an object $F(A)\in\mathbf{X^{\prime}};$ • for each arrow $f:A\rightarrow B,$ an arrow $F(f):F(A)\rightarrow F(B)$ such that – for each composable pair $f:A\rightarrow B$ and $g:B\rightarrow C$ in $\mathbf{X},$ $F(gf)\leq F(g)F(f),$ and – for each object $A\in\mathbf{X},$ $F(1_{A})\leq 1_{F(A)}.$
