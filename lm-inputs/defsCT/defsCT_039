Definition 2.10 ($\alpha$-renaming on variables in the dagger lambda calculus). A bound variable $x$ can be $\alpha$-renamed by replacing all of its instances, in a given sequent, with a bundle of bound variables $t$. The term $t$ has to be of the same type as $x$, must not contain any constants (since it will be a bundle of bound variables), and it must consist of variables that do not already appear in the sequent.
Definition 2.20 (Denotations). We will use the term denotations to refer to the equivalence classes that are formed by partitioning the sequents of the lambda calculus according to soup equivalence. Hence, two sequents will correspond to the same denotation if and only if they are equivalent up to soup reduction.
Definition 2.15 (Soup equivalence). We define a notion of soup equivalence as the reflexive, symmetric, and transitive closure of soup reduction. In other words, we say that two sequents $J_{1}$ and $J_{2}$ are soup-equivalent, or equivalent up to soup-reduction, when we can convert one to the other by using zero or more instances of $\alpha$-renaming and soup reduction.
Definition 2.9 (Bound variables and terms in the dagger lambda calculus). For any variable $x$, we say that it is a bound variable when it appears twice within a given sequent, regardless of where in the sequent those instances appear. We can also say that an instance of that variable is captured by the other instance of the variable in the sequent. As such, variable capture is not limited to the scope of a single term but spans the entire sequent. For any term $t$ that does not contain any occurrences of constants, we say that that term is captured when it consists entirely of variables that are captured within the scope of the current sequent. We use the phrases bound term and bundle of bound variables interchangeably when referring to captured terms. Trivially, a bound variable is also a bound term.
Definition 2.12 ($\alpha$-equivalence in the dagger lambda calculus). We define a notion of $\alpha$-equivalence as the reflexive, symmetric and transitive closure of $\alpha$-renaming. In other words, we say that two sequents are $\alpha$-equivalent, or equivalent up to $\alpha$-renaming, when one can be transformed to the other by $\alpha$-renaming zero or more terms.
Definition 2.4 (Scalars). One of the language’s atomic types, denoted by $I$, acts as the tensor unit. One of the very important properties of the type $I$ is negation invariance, whereby $I\equiv I^{*}$. We say that a term $i$ is a scalar iff it is of type $I$.
Definition 2.1 (Variables, constants and terms in the dagger lambda calculus). The fundamental building blocks of our language are variables; they are denoted by single letters and are traditionally represented using the later letters of the alphabet (i.e. $x,y,z$). We also allow for the use of constant terms (i.e. $c_{1},c_{2},c_{3}$); these are terms with an inherent value and cannot serve as placeholders for substitution. These primitives can then be combined with each other to form composite terms, denoted by different combinations of the following forms: $\langle term\rangle\;\;\;\;::=\;\;\;\;variable\;\;|\;\;\langle term\rangle_{*}% \;\;|\;\;\langle term\rangle\otimes\langle term\rangle\;\;|\;\;constant$
Definition 2.19 (Scalar multiplication). For any two scalars $m:I$ and $n:I$, we define a multiplication operation $m\cdot n:I$ such that: $m\cdot 1=1\cdot m=m$ and $\{m\cdot p:n\cdot q\}:=\{m:n,p:q\}$
Definition 2.13 (Typing contexts in the dagger lambda calculus). The left-hand-side of a typing judgement is actually a list of typed terms. We use the letters $\Gamma$ and $\Delta$ as shorthand for arbitrary (possibly empty) lists of such terms. Let $\Delta$ be the list $t_{1}:T_{1},t_{2}:T_{2},\ldots,t_{n}:T_{n}$. We define $\bigotimes\Delta$ to be the term $\left(\left(\left(t_{1}\otimes t_{2}\right)\otimes\ldots\right)\otimes t_{n}% \right):\left(\left(\left(T_{1}\otimes T_{2}\right)\otimes\ldots\right)\otimes T% _{n}\right)$, referring to it as $\Delta$ in tensor form.
Definition 2.7 (Soup). A soup is a set of soup connections, where not all of the connections have to be of the same type. The resulting soup is of the form $S=\{v_{1}:v_{2},\ldots,v_{m-1}:v_{m}\}$. All of the computation in our language is performed inside the relational soup, by treating its constituent soup connections as a form of explicit substitution. Our negation extends naturally into a soup negation whereby $(S\cup S^{\prime})_{*}:=S_{*}\cup S^{\prime}_{*}$.
Definition 2.2 (Types in the dagger lambda calculus). Every term in our language, regardless of whether it is a variable, a constant or composite, has a type. We will first start by defining a set of atomic types; these are traditionally represented using capital letters (i.e. $A,B,C$). Atomic types can then be combined to give us types of the following forms: $\langle type\rangle\;\;\;\;::=\;\;\;\;atomic\;\;\;|\;\;\;\langle type\rangle^{% *}\;\;\;|\;\;\;\langle type\rangle\otimes\langle type\rangle$
Definition 2.16 (Application in the dagger lambda calculus). Let $t$ and $f$ be terms such that $t:A$ and $f:A^{*}\otimes B$ for some types $A$ and $B$. We define the application $ft$ as a notational shorthand for representing a variable $x:B$, along with a connection in our soup. The origins of the application affect the structure of its corresponding soup connection: $ft:B,\Gamma\vdash c:C\;\;:=\;\;x:B,\Gamma\vdash_{\{f:t_{*}\otimes x\}_{*}}c:C$ and $\Gamma\vdash ft:B\;\;:=\;\;\Gamma\vdash_{\{f:t_{*}\otimes x\}}x:B$ For an application originating inside our soup, we have: $\{ft:c\}:=\{x:c\}\cup\{f:t_{*}\otimes x\}$ and $\{c:ft\}:=\{c:x\}\cup\{f:t_{*}\otimes x\}_{*}$
Definition 2.8 (Typing judgements in the dagger lambda calculus). The typing judgements, or sequents, of our language are composed of terms, their respective types, and a relational soup. A typing judgement is thus represented by: $t_{1}:A_{1},\;t_{2}:A_{2},\;\ldots,\;t_{n}:A_{n}\vdash_{S}t:B$
Definition 2.3 (Linear negation). The star operator is a form of linear negation whose De Morgan duality is defined by: $(a\otimes b)_{*}:=b_{*}\otimes a_{*}$ on terms and $(A\otimes B)^{*}:=B^{*}\otimes A^{*}$ on types.
Definition 2.6 (Soup connection). A soup connection is an ordered pair of equityped terms. A soup connection between two terms of type $A$ is written as $t_{1}:_{A}t_{2}$ and is an element of the cartesian product of the terms of type $A$ with themselves. To simplify our notation, we write the connection as $t_{1}:t_{2}$, omitting the type, whenever there is no ambiguity about the type of the connected terms. Soup connections do not form a symmetric relation; we use the property $a_{1}:a_{2}\equiv a_{2*}:a_{1*}$ to equate some soup terms by collapsing them into the same congruence class. Moreover, soup connections are not self-dual; we define a negation on soup connections as $(t:u)_{*}:=t_{*}:u_{*}\equiv u:t$.
Definition 2.11 ($\alpha$-renaming on terms in the dagger lambda calculus). A bound term $t$ can be $\alpha$-renamed by either $\alpha$-renaming its constituent variables or, in cases where $t$ appears twice in a given sequent, by replacing all of its instances with a variable $x$. The variable $x$ has to be of the same type as $t$ and it must not already appear in the sequent.
Definition 2.18 (Complex conjugation). Let $f:A^{*}\otimes B$ be an arbitrary function. As a notational convention, we set $f^{*}:=\bar{s}f:B\otimes A^{*}$.
Definition 2.7 Let $V$ be a ${\cal C}$-coalgebra and $A$ be a homotopy algebra of type ${\cal C}$ . Then ${\mathfrak{S}}\mathsf{Lie}_{\infty}$-algebra (2.10) is called the convolution algebra of the pair $(V,A)$ . We use the notation: ${\mathrm{Conv}}(V,A):={\mathrm{Hom}}(V,A)\,.$
Definition 2.3 Let $A$ and $B$ be homotopy algebras of type ${\cal C}$ and let $Q_{A}$ (resp. $Q_{B}$) be the MC element of ${\mathrm{coDer}}({\cal C}(A))$ (resp. ${\mathrm{coDer}}({\cal C}(B))$) corresponding to the homotopy algebra structure on $A$ (resp. on $B$). Then, an $\infty$-morphism from $A$ to $B$ is a homomorphism of dg ${\cal C}$-coalgebras $U~{}:~{}\Big{(}{\cal C}(A),{\partial}+Q_{A}\Big{)}~{}\to~{}\Big{(}{\cal C}(B),% {\partial}+Q_{B}\Big{)}\,.$
Definition 2.2 Homotopy algebras of type ${\cal C}$ are algebras in ${\mathsf{Ch}}_{{\Bbbk}}$ over the operad ${\mathrm{Cobar}}({\cal C})$ .
Definition 4.7 Let $A,B$ be ${\mathrm{Cobar}}({\cal C})$-algebras. We say that $\infty$-morphisms $F,G$ from $A$ to $B$ are homotopic if the corresponding $0$-cells $F^{\prime}$ and $G^{\prime}$ are connected in $\mathfrak{MC}_{{\bullet}}({\mathbf{map}}(A,B))$.
Definition 1.1 An algebraic system $\underline{B}=(B,0,1,\vee,\wedge,{}^{*},C)$ is called a contact algebra (abbreviated as CA) if $(B,0,1,\vee,\wedge,{}^{*})$ is a Boolean algebra (where the operation $``$complement” is denoted by $``\ {}^{*}\ $”) and $C$ is a binary relation on $B$, satisfying the following axioms: (C1) If $a\not=0$ then $aCa$; (C2) If $aCb$ then $a\not=0$ and $b\not=0$; (C3) $aCb$ implies $bCa$; (C4) $aC(b\vee c)$ iff $aCb$ or $aCc$. Usually, we shall simply write $(B,C)$ for a contact algebra. The relation $C$ is called a contact relation. When $B$ is a complete Boolean algebra, we will say that $(B,C)$ is a complete contact algebra (abbreviated as CCA). We will say that two CA’s $(B_{1},C_{1})$ and $(B_{2},C_{2})$ are CA-isomorphic iff there exists a Boolean isomorphism $\varphi:B_{1}\longrightarrow B_{2}$ such that, for each $a,b\in B_{1}$, $aC_{1}b$ iff $\varphi(a)C_{2}\varphi(b)$. Note that in this paper, by a $``$Boolean isomorphism” we understand an isomorphism in the category ${\bf Bool}$. A CA $(B,C)$ is called connected if it satisfies the following axiom: (CON) If $a\neq 0,1$ then $aCa^{*}$. A contact algebra $(B,C)$ is called a normal contact algebra (abbreviated as NCA) ([9, 11]) if it satisfies the following axioms (we will write $``-C$” for $``not\ C$”): (C5) If $a(-C)b$ then $a(-C)c$ and $b(-C)c^{*}$ for some $c\in B$; (C6) If $a\not=1$ then there exists $b\not=0$ such that $b(-C)a$. A normal CA is called a complete normal contact algebra (abbreviated as CNCA) if it is a CCA. The notion of normal contact algebra was introduced by Fedorchuk [11] under the name Boolean $\delta$-algebra as an equivalent expression of the notion of compingent Boolean algebra of de Vries. We call such algebras $``$normal contact algebras” because they form a subclass of the class of contact algebras. Note that if $0\neq 1$ then the axiom (C2) follows from the axioms (C6) and (C4). For any CA $(B,C)$, we define a binary relation $``\ll_{C}$” on $B$ (called non-tangential inclusion) by $``\ a\ll_{C}b\leftrightarrow a(-C)b^{*}\ $”. Sometimes we will write simply $``\ll$” instead of $``\ll_{C}$”.
Definition 2.2 (De Vries [9]) Let ${\bf HC}$ be the category of all compact Hausdorff spaces and all continuous maps between them. Let ${\bf DVAL}$ be the category whose objects are all complete NCAs and whose morphisms are all functions $\varphi:(A,C)\longrightarrow(B,C^{\prime})$ between the objects of ${\bf DVAL}$ satisfying the conditions: (DVAL1) $\varphi(0)=0$; (DVAL2) $\varphi(a\wedge b)=\varphi(a)\wedge\varphi(b)$, for all $a,b\in A$; (DVAL3) If $a,b\in A$ and $a\ll_{C}b$ then $(\varphi(a^{*}))^{*}\ll_{C^{\prime}}\varphi(b)$; (DVAL4) $\varphi(a)=\bigvee\{\varphi(b)\ |\ b\ll_{C}a\}$, for every $a\in A$, and let the composition $``\ast$” of two morphisms $\varphi_{1}:(A_{1},C_{1})\longrightarrow(A_{2},C_{2})$ and $\varphi_{2}:(A_{2},C_{2})\longrightarrow(A_{3},C_{3})$ of ${\bf DVAL}$ be defined by the formula $\varphi_{2}\ast\varphi_{1}=(\varphi_{2}\circ\varphi_{1})\,\breve{}\,,$ where, for every function $\psi:(A,C)\longrightarrow(B,C^{\prime})$ between two objects of ${\bf DVAL}$, $\psi\,\breve{}\,:(A,C)\longrightarrow(B,C^{\prime})$ is defined as follows: $\psi\,\breve{}\,(a)=\bigvee\{\psi(b)\ |\ b\ll_{C}a\},$ for every $a\in A$.
Definition 1.7 ([15]) An algebraic system $\underline{B}_{\,l}=(B,0,1,\vee,\wedge,{}^{*},\rho,{\rm I}\!{\rm B})$ is called a local contact algebra (abbreviated as LCA) if $(B,0,1,\vee,\wedge,{}^{*})$ is a Boolean algebra, $\rho$ is a binary relation on $B$ such that $(B,\rho)$ is a CA, and ${\rm I}\!{\rm B}$ is an ideal (possibly non proper) of $B$, satisfying the following axioms: (BC1) If $a\in{\rm I}\!{\rm B}$, $c\in B$ and $a\ll_{\rho}c$ then $a\ll_{\rho}b\ll_{\rho}c$ for some $b\in{\rm I}\!{\rm B}$ (see 1.1 for $``\ll_{\rho}$”); (BC2) If $a\rho b$ then there exists an element $c$ of ${\rm I}\!{\rm B}$ such that $a\rho(c\wedge b)$; (BC3) If $a\neq 0$ then there exists $b\in{\rm I}\!{\rm B}\setminus\{0\}$ such that $b\ll_{\rho}a$. Usually, we shall simply write $(B,\rho,{\rm I}\!{\rm B})$ for a local contact algebra. We will say that the elements of ${\rm I}\!{\rm B}$ are bounded and the elements of $B\setminus{\rm I}\!{\rm B}$ are unbounded. When $B$ is a complete Boolean algebra, the LCA $(B,\rho,{\rm I}\!{\rm B})$ is called a complete local contact algebra (abbreviated as CLCA). We will say that two local contact algebras $(B,\rho,{\rm I}\!{\rm B})$ and $(B_{1},\rho_{1},{\rm I}\!{\rm B}_{1})$ are LCA-isomorphic iff there exists a Boolean isomorphism $\varphi:B\longrightarrow B_{1}$ such that, for $a,b\in B$, $a\rho b$ iff $\varphi(a)\rho_{1}\varphi(b)$, and $\varphi(a)\in{\rm I}\!{\rm B}_{1}$ iff $a\in{\rm I}\!{\rm B}$. An LCA $(B,\rho,{\rm I}\!{\rm B})$ is called connected if the CA $(B,\rho)$ is connected.
Definition 2.4 We will denote by ${\bf PLC}$ the category of all locally compact Hausdorff spaces and all perfect maps between them. Let ${\bf PAL}$ be the category whose objects are all complete LCAs and whose morphisms are all functions $\varphi:(A,\rho,{\rm I}\!{\rm B})\longrightarrow(B,\eta,{\rm I}\!{\rm B}^{% \prime})$ between the objects of ${\bf PAL}$ satisfying the conditions: (PAL1) $\varphi(0)=0$; (PAL2) $\varphi(a\wedge b)=\varphi(a)\wedge\varphi(b)$, for all $a,b\in A$; (PAL3) If $a\in{\rm I}\!{\rm B},b\in A$ and $a\ll_{\rho}b$ then $(\varphi(a^{*}))^{*}\ll_{\eta}\varphi(b)$; (PAL4) For every $b\in{\rm I}\!{\rm B}^{\prime}$ there exists $a\in{\rm I}\!{\rm B}$ such that $b\leq\varphi(a)$; (PAL5) If $a\in{\rm I}\!{\rm B}$ then $\varphi(a)\in{\rm I}\!{\rm B}^{\prime}$; (PAL6) $\varphi(a)=\bigvee\{\varphi(b)\ |\ b\ll_{C_{\rho}}a\}$, for every $a\in A$ (see (1) for $C_{\rho}$); let the composition $``\diamond$” of two morphisms $\varphi_{1}:(A_{1},\rho_{1},{\rm I}\!{\rm B}_{1})\longrightarrow(A_{2},\rho_{2% },{\rm I}\!{\rm B}_{2})$ and $\varphi_{2}:(A_{2},\rho_{2},{\rm I}\!{\rm B}_{2})\longrightarrow(A_{3},\rho_{3% },{\rm I}\!{\rm B}_{3})$ of ${\bf PAL}$ be defined by the formula $\varphi_{2}\diamond\varphi_{1}=(\varphi_{2}\circ\varphi_{1})\,\check{}\,,$ where, for every function $\psi:(A,\rho,{\rm I}\!{\rm B})\longrightarrow(B,\eta,{\rm I}\!{\rm B}^{\prime})$ between two objects of ${\bf PAL}$, $\psi\,\check{}\,:(A,\rho,{\rm I}\!{\rm B})\longrightarrow(B,\eta,{\rm I}\!{\rm B% }^{\prime})$ is defined as follows: $\psi\,\check{}\,(a)=\bigvee\{\psi(b)\ |\ b\ll_{C_{\rho}}a\},$ for every $a\in A$. By ${\bf NAL}$ we denote the full subcategory of ${\bf PAL}$ having as objects all CNCAs (i.e., those CLCAs $(A,\rho,{\rm I}\!{\rm B})$ for which ${\rm I}\!{\rm B}=A$).
Definition 1.11 Let $(B,\rho,{\rm I}\!{\rm B})$ be a local contact algebra. A cluster $\sigma$ in $(B,C_{\rho})$ (see 1.9) is called bounded if $\sigma\cap{\rm I}\!{\rm B}\neq\emptyset$. The set of all bounded clusters in $(B,C_{\rho})$ will be denoted by $\mbox{{\rm BClust}}(B,\rho,{\rm I}\!{\rm B})$.
Definition 2.20 Let ${\bf OpPerLC}$ be the category of all locally compact Hausdorff spaces and all open perfect maps between them. Let ${\bf DOpPerLC}$ be the category whose objects are all complete local contact algebras (see 1.14) and whose morphisms are all ${\bf DSkePerLC}$-morphisms satisfying condition (LO). It is easy to see that in this way we have defined categories. Obviously, ${\bf DOpPerLC}$ (resp., ${\bf OpPerLC}$) is a subcategory of the category ${\bf DSkePerLC}$ (resp., ${\bf SkePerLC}$).
Definition 4.5 Let ${\bf ESkePerLC}$ be the category whose objects are all complete local contact algebras (see 1.14) and whose morphisms are all ${\bf ESkeLC}$-morphisms $\psi:(A,\rho,{\rm I}\!{\rm B})\longrightarrow(B,\eta,{\rm I}\!{\rm B}^{\prime})$ satisfying the following condition: (EL6) if $b\in{\rm I}\!{\rm B}^{\prime}$ then $\psi_{P}(b)\in{\rm I}\!{\rm B}$ (where $\psi_{P}$ is the right adjoint of $\psi$ (see 1.21)).
Definition 2.12 (Fedorchuk [11]) We will denote by ${\bf SkeC}$ the category of all compact Hausdorff spaces and all quasi-open maps between them. Let ${\bf DSkeC}$ be the category whose objects are all complete normal contact algebras and whose morphisms $\varphi:(A,C)\longrightarrow(B,C^{\prime})$ are all complete Boolean homomorphisms $\varphi:A\longrightarrow B$ satisfying the following condition: (F1) For all $a,b\in A$, $\varphi(a)C^{\prime}\varphi(b)$ implies $aCb$. It is easy to see that in this way we have defined categories.
Definition 1.14 ([20]) An algebraic system $\underline{B}_{\,l}=(B,0,1,\vee,\wedge,{}^{*},\rho,{\rm I}\!{\rm B})$ is called a local contact algebra (abbreviated as LCA) if $(B,0,1,\vee,\wedge,{}^{*})$ is a Boolean algebra, $\rho$ is a binary relation on $B$ such that $(B,\rho)$ is a CA, and ${\rm I}\!{\rm B}$ is an ideal (possibly non proper) of $B$, satisfying the following axioms: (BC1) If $a\in{\rm I}\!{\rm B}$, $c\in B$ and $a\ll_{\rho}c$ then $a\ll_{\rho}b\ll_{\rho}c$ for some $b\in{\rm I}\!{\rm B}$ (see 1.1 for $``\ll_{\rho}$”); (BC2) If $a\rho b$ then there exists an element $c$ of ${\rm I}\!{\rm B}$ such that $a\rho(c\wedge b)$; (BC3) If $a\neq 0$ then there exists $b\in{\rm I}\!{\rm B}\setminus\{0\}$ such that $b\ll_{\rho}a$. Usually, we shall simply write $(B,\rho,{\rm I}\!{\rm B})$ for a local contact algebra. We will say that the elements of ${\rm I}\!{\rm B}$ are bounded and the elements of $B\setminus{\rm I}\!{\rm B}$ are unbounded. When $B$ is a complete Boolean algebra, the LCA $(B,\rho,{\rm I}\!{\rm B})$ is called a complete local contact algebra (abbreviated by CLCA). We will say that two local contact algebras $(B,\rho,{\rm I}\!{\rm B})$ and $(B_{1},\rho_{1},{\rm I}\!{\rm B}_{1})$ are LCA-isomorphic iff there exists a Boolean isomorphism $\varphi:B\longrightarrow B_{1}$ such that, for $a,b\in B$, $a\rho b$ iff $\varphi(a)\rho_{1}\varphi(b)$, and $\varphi(a)\in{\rm I}\!{\rm B}_{1}$ iff $a\in{\rm I}\!{\rm B}$.
Definition 4.3 Let ${\bf ESkeLC}$ be the category whose objects are all complete local contact algebras and whose morphisms $\psi:(A,\rho,{\rm I}\!{\rm B})\longrightarrow(B,\eta,{\rm I}\!{\rm B}^{\prime})$ are all functions $\psi:A\longrightarrow B$ satisfying conditions (EF1)-(EF3) (see Definition 4.1) and the following two constraints: (EL4) for every $a,b\in A$, $a\rho b$ implies that $\psi(a)\eta\psi(b)$; (EL5) if $a\in{\rm I}\!{\rm B}$ then $\psi(a)\in{\rm I}\!{\rm B}^{\prime}$.
Definition 2.3 ([15]) A continuous map $f:X\longrightarrow Y$ is called quasi-open if for every non-empty open subset $U$ of $X$, $\mbox{{\rm int}}(f(U))\neq\emptyset$ holds.
Definition 4.9 Let ${\bf EOpC}$ be the category whose objects are all complete normal contact algebras and whose morphisms are all ${\bf ESkeC}$-morphisms $\psi:(A,C)\longrightarrow(B,C^{\prime})$ satisfying the following condition: (EC7) if $a\in A$, $b\in B$ and $\psi(a)\,C^{\prime}\,b$ then $a\,C\,\psi_{P}(b)$ (where $\psi_{P}$ is the right adjoint of $\psi$ (see 1.21)).
Definition 2.16 Let ${\bf OpLC}$ be the category of all locally compact Hausdorff spaces and all open maps between them. Let ${\bf DOpLC}$ be the category whose objects are all complete local contact algebras and whose morphisms are all ${\bf DSkeLC}$-morphisms $\varphi:(A,\rho,{\rm I}\!{\rm B})\longrightarrow(B,\eta,{\rm I}\!{\rm B}^{% \prime})$ satisfying the following condition: (LO) $\forall a\in A$ and $\forall b\in{\rm I}\!{\rm B}^{\prime}$, $\varphi_{\Lambda}(b)\rho a$ implies $b\eta\varphi(a)$. It is easy to see that in this way we have defined categories. Obviously, ${\bf DOpLC}$ (resp., ${\bf OpLC}$) is a (non-full) subcategory of the category ${\bf DSkeLC}$ (resp., ${\bf SkeLC}$).
Definition 4.11 Let ${\bf EOpPerLC}$ be the category whose objects are all complete local contact algebras and whose morphisms are all ${\bf ESkePerLC}$-morphisms satisfying condition (EL7).
Definition 2.14 Let ${\bf SkePerLC}$ be the category of all locally compact Hausdorff spaces and all skeletal perfect maps between them. Note that, by 2.5(b), the morphisms of the category ${\bf SkePerLC}$ are precisely the quasi-open perfect maps. Let ${\bf DSkePerLC}$ be the category whose objects are all complete local contact algebras (see 1.14) and whose morphisms are all ${\bf DSkeLC}$-morphisms $\varphi:(A,\rho,{\rm I}\!{\rm B})\longrightarrow(B,\eta,{\rm I}\!{\rm B}^{% \prime})$ satisfying the following condition: (L3) $a\in{\rm I}\!{\rm B}$ implies $\varphi(a)\in{\rm I}\!{\rm B}^{\prime}$. It is easy to see that in this way we have defined categories. Obviously, ${\bf SkePerLC}$ (resp., ${\bf DSkePerLC}$) is a (non-full) subcategory of the category ${\bf SkeLC}$ (resp., ${\bf DSkeLC}$).
Definition 4.7 Let ${\bf EOpLC}$ be the category whose objects are all complete local contact algebras and whose morphisms are all ${\bf ESkeLC}$-morphisms $\psi:(A,\rho,{\rm I}\!{\rm B})\longrightarrow(B,\eta,{\rm I}\!{\rm B}^{\prime})$ satisfying the following condition: (EL7) if $b\in B$, $a\in{\rm I}\!{\rm B}$ and $\psi(a)\eta b$ then $a\rho\psi_{P}(b)$ (where $\psi_{P}$ is the right adjoint of $\psi$ (see 1.21)).
Definition 1.18 Let $(B,\rho,{\rm I}\!{\rm B})$ be a local contact algebra. A cluster $\sigma$ in $(B,C_{\rho})$ (see 1.16) is called bounded if $\sigma\cap{\rm I}\!{\rm B}\neq\emptyset$. The set of all bounded clusters in $(B,C_{\rho})$ will be denoted by $\mbox{{\rm BClust}}(B,\rho,{\rm I}\!{\rm B})$. An ultrafilter $u$ in $B$ is called a bounded ultrafilter if $u\cap{\rm I}\!{\rm B}\neq\emptyset$.
Definition 4.1 ([11]) Let ${\bf ESkeC}$ be the category whose objects are all complete normal contact algebras and whose morphisms $\psi:(A,C)\longrightarrow(B,C^{\prime})$ are all functions $\psi:A\longrightarrow B$ satisfying the following conditions: (EF1) for every $a\in A$, $\psi(a)=0$ iff $a=0$; (EF2) $\psi$ preserves all joins; (EF3) if $a\in A$, $b\in B$ and $b\leq\psi(a)$ then there exists $c\in A$ such that $c\leq a$ and $\psi(c)=b$; (EF4) for every $a,b\in A$, $aCb$ implies that $\psi(a)C^{\prime}\psi(b)$.
Definition 1.1 An algebraic system $\underline{B}=(B,0,1,\vee,\wedge,{}^{*},C)$ is called a contact algebra (abbreviated as CA) ([7]) if $(B,0,1,\vee,\wedge,{}^{*})$ is a Boolean algebra (where the operation $``$complement” is denoted by $``\ {}^{*}\ $”) and $C$ is a binary relation on $B$, satisfying the following axioms: (C1) If $a\not=0$ then $aCa$; (C2) If $aCb$ then $a\not=0$ and $b\not=0$; (C3) $aCb$ implies $bCa$; (C4) $aC(b\vee c)$ iff $aCb$ or $aCc$. Usually, we shall simply write $(B,C)$ for a contact algebra. The relation $C$ is called a contact relation. When $B$ is a complete Boolean algebra, we will say that $(B,C)$ is a complete contact algebra (abbreviated as CCA). For every two subsets $M$ and $N$ of $B$, we will write $MCN$ when $mCn$, for every $m\in M$ and every $n\in N$. We will say that two CA’s $(B_{1},C_{1})$ and $(B_{2},C_{2})$ are CA-isomorphic iff there exists a Boolean isomorphism $\varphi:B_{1}\longrightarrow B_{2}$ such that, for each $a,b\in B_{1}$, $aC_{1}b$ iff $\varphi(a)C_{2}\varphi(b)$. Note that in this paper, by a $``$Boolean isomorphism” we understand an isomorphism in the category ${\bf Bool}$. A CA $(B,C)$ is called connected if it satisfies the following axiom: (CON) If $a\neq 0,1$ then $aCa^{*}$. A contact algebra $(B,C)$ is called a normal contact algebra (abbreviated as NCA) ([7, 11]) if it satisfies the following axioms (we will write $``-C$” for $``not\ C$”): (C5) If $a(-C)b$ then $a(-C)c$ and $b(-C)c^{*}$ for some $c\in B$; (C6) If $a\not=1$ then there exists $b\not=0$ such that $b(-C)a$. A normal CA is called a complete normal contact algebra (abbreviated as CNCA) if it is a CCA. Note that if $0\neq 1$ then the axiom (C2) follows from the axioms (C6) and (C4). For any CA $(B,C)$, we define a binary relation $``\ll_{C}$” on $B$ (called non-tangential inclusion) by $``\ a\ll_{C}b\leftrightarrow a(-C)b^{*}\ $”. Sometimes we will write simply $``\ll$” instead of $``\ll_{C}$”.
Definition 2.10 Let ${\bf SkeLC}$ be the category of all locally compact Hausdorff spaces and all continuous skeletal maps between them. Let ${\bf DSkeLC}$ be the category whose objects are all complete local contact algebras and whose morphisms $\varphi:(A,\rho,{\rm I}\!{\rm B})\longrightarrow(B,\eta,{\rm I}\!{\rm B}^{% \prime})$ are all complete Boolean homomorphisms $\varphi:A\longrightarrow B$ satisfying the following conditions: (L1) $\forall a,b\in A$, $\varphi(a)\eta\varphi(b)$ implies $a\rho b$; (L2) $b\in{\rm I}\!{\rm B}^{\prime}$ implies $\varphi_{\Lambda}(b)\in{\rm I}\!{\rm B}$ (see 1.21 for $\varphi_{\Lambda}$). It is easy to see that in this way we have defined categories. Let us note that (L1) is equivalent to the following condition: (EL1) $\forall a,b\in B$, $a\eta b$ implies $\varphi_{\Lambda}(a)\rho\varphi_{\Lambda}(b)$.
Definition 1.6 In analogy to the corresponding definitions in the theory of proximity spaces (see, e.g., [17]), we say that: (a) a subset $\xi$ of an NCA $(B,C)$ is called an end if the following conditions are satisfied: (E1) for any $b,c\in\xi$ there exists $a\in\xi$ such that $a\neq 0$, $a\ll b$ and $a\ll c$; (E2) if $a,b\in B$ and $a\ll b$ then either $a^{*}\in\xi$ or $b\in\xi$; (b) a subset $v$ of an NCA $(B,C)$ is called a round filter if it is a filter and for every $b\in v$ there exists $a\in v$ such that $a\ll b$.
Definition 2.18 We will denote by ${\bf OpC}$ the category of all compact Hausdorff spaces and all open maps between them. Let ${\bf DOpC}$ be the category whose objects are all complete normal contact algebras and whose morphisms are all ${\bf DSkeC}$-morphisms $\varphi:(A,C)\longrightarrow(B,C^{\prime})$ satisfying the following condition: (CO) For all $a\in A$ and all $b\in B$, $aC\varphi_{\Lambda}(b)$ implies $\varphi(a)C^{\prime}b$ (see 1.21 for $\varphi_{\Lambda}$). It is easy to see that in this way we have defined categories. The category ${\bf DOpC}$ (resp., ${\bf OpC}$) is a (non-full) subcategory of the category ${\bf DSkeC}$ (resp., ${\bf SkeC}$).
Definition 2.2. Let $A$ be a ring and $B$ an $A$-algebra. A semi-free DG algebra resolution of $B$ relative to $A$ is a quasi-isomorphism $\tilde{B}\to B$ of DG $A$-algebras, where $\tilde{B}$ is a semi-free DG $A$-algebra.
Definition 2.7. Say $(M,\rho)$ and $(N,\sigma)$ are rigid complexes over $B$ relative to $A$. A morphism $\phi:M\to N$ in $\mathsf{D}(\operatorname{\mathsf{Mod}}B)$ is called a rigid morphism relative to $A$ if the diagram $\begin{CD}M@>{\rho}>{}>\operatorname{Sq}_{B/A}M\\ @V{\phi}V{}V@V{}V{\operatorname{Sq}_{B/A}(\phi)}V\\ N@>{\sigma}>{}>\operatorname{Sq}_{B/A}N\end{CD}$ is commutative.
Definition 5.1. A ring $A$ is called tractable if there is an essentially finite type homomorphism $\mathbb{K}\to A$, for some regular noetherian ring of finite Krull dimension $\mathbb{K}$.
Definition 4.1. A rigid dualizing complex over $A$ relative to $\mathbb{K}$ is a rigid complex $(R_{A},\rho_{A})$, such that $R_{A}$ is a dualizing complex.
Definition 4.3. Given a homomorphism $f^{*}:A\to B$ in $\operatorname{\mathsf{EFTAlg}}/\mathbb{K}$, define the twisted inverse image functor $f^{!}:\mathsf{D}^{+}_{\mathrm{f}}(\operatorname{\mathsf{Mod}}A)\to\mathsf{D}^{% +}_{\mathrm{f}}(\operatorname{\mathsf{Mod}}B)$ by the formula $f^{!}M:=\operatorname{RHom}_{B}\bigl{(}B\otimes^{\mathrm{L}}_{A}\operatorname{% RHom}_{A}(M,R_{A}),R_{B}\bigr{)}.$
Definition 2.6. Let $B$ be a noetherian $A$-algebra, and let $M$ be a complex in $\mathsf{D}^{\mathrm{b}}_{\mathrm{f}}(\operatorname{\mathsf{Mod}}B)$ that has finite flat dimension over $A$. Assume $\rho:M\stackrel{{\scriptstyle\simeq}}{{\rightarrow}}\operatorname{Sq}_{B/A}M$ is an isomorphism in $\mathsf{D}(\operatorname{\mathsf{Mod}}B)$. Then the pair $(M,\rho)$ is called a rigid complex over $B$ relative to $A$.
Definition 1.1. (Grothendieck [RD]) A dualizing complex over $A$ is a complex $R\in\mathsf{D}^{\mathrm{b}}_{\mathrm{f}}(\operatorname{\mathsf{Mod}}A)$ satisfying the two conditions: (i) $R$ has finite injective dimension. (ii) The canonical morphism $A\to\operatorname{RHom}_{A}(R,R)$ is an isomorphism.
