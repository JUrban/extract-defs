Definition 2.3. A stratification on a precubical set $X$ is a sequence of sets $t_{1}X,t_{2}X,\ldots\,$ such that $t_{n}X$ is a subset of $X_{n}$. A precubical set $X$ with a stratification $t_{n}X$ is called a stratified precubical set, and the members of $t_{n}X$ are called thin $n$-cubes. A morphism of stratified precubical sets is a morphism of precubical sets taking thin $n$-cubes to thin $n$-cubes.
Definition 2.5. Let $X$ be a precubical set and let $\partial_{k}^{\gamma}$ be a face operation on $n$-cubes. Then an $n$-box $b$ in $X$ opposite $\partial_{k}^{\gamma}$ is a collection of $(n-1)$-cubes $b_{i}^{\alpha}$, indexed by the $(2n-1)$ face operations $\partial_{i}^{\alpha}$ on $n$-cubes other than $\partial_{k}^{\gamma}$, such that $\partial_{i}^{\alpha}b_{j}^{\beta}=\partial_{j}^{\beta}b_{i+1}^{\alpha}\ \text% {for $i\geq j$}.$ A filler for an $n$-shell $b$ is an $n$-cube $x$ such that $\partial_{i}^{\alpha}x=b_{i}^{\alpha}$ for $\partial_{i}^{\alpha}\neq\partial_{k}^{\gamma}$.
Definition 2.4. Let $X$ be a precubical set. Then an $n$-shell $s$ in $X$ is a collection of $(n-1)$-cubes $s_{i}^{\alpha}$, indexed by the $2n$ face operations $\partial_{i}^{\alpha}$ on $n$-cubes, such that $\partial_{i}^{\alpha}s_{j}^{\beta}=\partial_{j}^{\beta}s_{i+1}^{\alpha}\ \text% {for $i\geq j$}.$ A filler for an $n$-shell $s$ is an $n$-cube $x$ such that $\partial_{i}^{\alpha}x=s_{i}^{\alpha}$ for all $\partial_{i}^{\alpha}$.
Definition 2.1. The precubical category is the category with objects $[0]$, $[1]$, … indexed by the natural numbers and with a generating set of morphisms $\check{\partial}_{1}^{-},\check{\partial}_{1}^{+},\ldots,\check{\partial}_{n}^% {-},\check{\partial}_{n}^{+}\colon[n-1]\to[n]$ subject to the relations $\check{\partial}_{j}^{\beta}\check{\partial}_{i}^{\alpha}=\check{\partial}_{i+% 1}^{\alpha}\check{\partial}_{j}^{\beta}\ \text{for $i\geq j$}.$ A precubical set is a contravariant functor from the precubical category to sets; equivalently, a precubical set $X$ is a sequence of sets $X_{0},X_{1},\ldots\,$ together with face operations $\partial_{1}^{-},\partial_{1}^{+},\ldots,\partial_{n}^{-},\partial_{n}^{+}% \colon X_{n}\to X_{n-1}$ such that $\partial_{i}^{\alpha}\partial_{j}^{\beta}=\partial_{j}^{\beta}\partial_{i+1}^{% \alpha}\ \text{for $i\geq j$}.$ If $X$ is a precubical set then the members of $X_{n}$ are called $n$-cubes. An operation from $n$-cubes to $m$-cubes induced by a morphism in the precubical category is called a precubical operation. A morphism of precubical sets from $X$ to $Y$ is a sequence of functions from $X_{n}$ to $Y_{n}$ commuting with the face operations.
Definition 5. A Schrödinger representation of the Weyl algebra is a representation on a space of functions $\psi:\mathbbm{R}\rightarrow\mathbbm{C}$, with the position operator $q$ and momentum operator $p$ represented as $\begin{array}[]{lll}p\psi(x)=-i\psi^{\prime}(x)&and&q\psi(x)=x\cdot\psi(x)\end% {array}$
Definition 9. The groupoid cardinality of a groupoid $\mathcal{G}$ is $|\mathcal{G}|=\sum_{[x]\in\underline{\mathcal{G}}}\frac{1}{|\operatorname{Aut}% (x)|}$ where $\underline{\mathcal{G}}$ is the set of isomorphism classes of objects of $\mathcal{G}$. We call a groupoid tame if this sum converges.
Definition 3. The Weyl algebra is the complex algebra generated by the ladder operators, namely the creation operator $a^{\ast}$ and the annihilation operator $a$. These satisfy the relations $[a,a^{\ast}]=aa^{\ast}-a^{\ast}a=1$. The Fock representation of the Weyl algebra on the vector space of formal power series in $z$ is determined by the effect of these generators: $af(z)=\frac{\mathrm{d}f(z)}{\mathrm{d}z}$ and $a^{\ast}f(z)=zf(z)$
Definition 7. The structure-type operator $A$ acts on a structure type $F$ to give a structure type $AF$, for which putting an $AF$-structure on a set $S$ is to adjoin a new element, which we denote $\star$, to $S$ and then put an $F$-structure on $S\cup\{\star\}$. The adjoint operator, $A^{\ast}$ is the one which acts on a structure type $F$ by giving a structure type $A^{\ast}F$ for which putting an $A^{\ast}F$-structure on a set $S$ is the same as removing an element from $S$ and putting an $F$-structure on the resulting set.
Definition 10. A $Z_{0}$-coloured set is a set $S$ equipped with a colouring map $c:S\rightarrow Z_{0}$. Maps of $Z_{0}$-coloured sets in $\hom((S,c),(S^{\prime},c^{\prime}))$ are bijections $\sigma:S\rightarrow S^{\prime}$ together with, for each $x\in S$, a morphism $f_{x}\in\hom(c(x),c^{\prime}(\sigma(x))$. That is,
Definition 4. Two generators $p$ and $q$ of the Weyl algebra are given in terms of $a$ and $a^{\ast}$ by $\begin{array}[]{lll}q=\frac{a+a^{\ast}}{\sqrt{2}}&and&p=\frac{a-a^{\ast}}{% \sqrt{2}\mathrm{i}}\end{array}$ or equivalently, $\begin{array}[]{lll}a=\frac{q+\mathrm{i}p}{\sqrt{2}}&and&a^{\ast}=\frac{q-% \mathrm{i}p}{\sqrt{2}}\end{array}$
Definition 8. A groupoid is a category in which all morphisms are invertible.
Definition 1. A structure type is a functor from the category $\boldsymbol{\operatorname{{FinSet_{0}}}}$ whose objects are finite sets, and whose morphisms are the bijections1$\boldsymbol{\operatorname{{FinSet_{0}}}}$ is Joyal’s $B$ (for “bijection”). It makes no difference from which universe we take these sets - a skeletal version of $\boldsymbol{\operatorname{{FinSet_{0}}}}$ consisting of only pure sets, one per cardinality, will do as well as any other for our purposes., into the category $\boldsymbol{\operatorname{{Set}}}$: $F:\boldsymbol{\operatorname{{FinSet_{0}}}}\rightarrow\boldsymbol{\operatorname% {{Set}}}$ These functors naturally form a category whose morphisms are the natural transformations $\alpha:F\rightarrow F^{\prime}$. We denote this category by $\boldsymbol{\operatorname{{Set[Z]}}}$.
Definition 2. Given two structure types $F$ and $G$, there are sum and product structure types $F+G$ and $F\cdot G$, defined as follows. Putting an $F+G$-structure on a set $S$ consists of making a choice of $F$ or $G$, and putting a structure of that type on $S$. Putting an $F\cdot G$-structure on $S$ consists of splitting $S$ into an ordered pair of disjoint subsets, then putting an $F$-structure on the first part and a $G$-structure on the second part.
Definition 6. The inner product on $\mathbbm{C}[z]$ is defined by its operation on the basis $\{z^{n}\}$ by $\left\langle{z^{n},z^{m}}\right\rangle=\delta_{n,m}n!$. The space of states of the harmonic oscillator consists of all power series with finite norm according to this inner product.
Definition 4.1. Suppose that $X$ is a $kG$-module, then $X$ is virtually $W$-projective if the induced map $\mathrm{Tr}_{W}:\mathrm{Ext}_{kG}^{n}(X\otimes W,Y\otimes W)\to\mathrm{Ext}_{% kG}^{n}(X,Y)$ is surjective for all $n$ sufficiently large.
Definition 5.2. An $F$-projective resolution of a cochain complex $X$ is a complex whose terms are $F$-projective, with a map of complexes in the category of complexes $p:P\to X$ such that the cone of $p$ is zero in $D_{F}(\mathcal{A})$.
Definition 3.5. When the hypothesis of the theorem are met we shall call the corresponding triangulated category the $F$-stable category. We will use $(?,?)_{F}$ for morphisms in the $F$-stable category.
Definition 3.1. Given functors and categories as above, we will define the $F$-projective objects to be the thick subcategory of all direct summands of the image of $L$ $\mathcal{P}:=\{P\in\mathcal{A}\ :\ P|LY\ \mathrm{for\ some}\ Y\in\mathcal{B}\}.$ Given some $X$ in $\mathcal{A}$ the canonical $F$-projective cover is the deflation $\epsilon_{X}:LFX\to X$. The translation functor is given by the exact pair $\Omega_{F}(X)\to LFX\to X.$ Dually we use $R$ and the unit $\eta$ to define $\mathcal{I}$ the class of $F$-injective objects, canonical $F$-injective hull and $\Omega_{F}^{-1}$ from the exact pair $X\to FRX\to\Omega^{-1}(X).$ Note that $\Omega$ and $\Omega^{-1}$ are only inverse functors in the quotient category. Define $\Delta$ to be the class of all exact pairs in $\mathcal{A}$ that split upon applying $F$.
Definition 5.1. With $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{L}$ as above define the localization $D_{F}(\mathcal{A}):=\frac{\mathrm{K}(\mathcal{A})}{\mathcal{L}}$ and the categories $D^{-}_{F}(\mathcal{A})$ is the localization of complexes in K whose terms are zero in all sufficiently high degrees (similarly for $+$ and $b$ instead of $-$).
Definition 1.1. A Segal precategory is a simplicial space $X$ such that $X_{0}$ is a discrete simplicial set.
Definition 1.2. [hs, §2] A Segal category $X$ is a Segal precategory such that the Segal map $\varphi_{k}$ is a weak equivalence of simplicial sets for each $k\geq 2$.
Definition 4.6. A ${\mathbf{t}}$-linear structure ${\mathsf{A}}$ has flags if: (*) For any $i$ with $\dim(V_{i})>1$, for some $j,k$ with $\dim(V_{j})=\dim(V_{i})-1$, $\dim V_{k}=1$, there exists a $0$-definable exact sequence $0\to V_{k}\to V_{i}\to V_{j}\to 0$.
Definition 2.13. $T$ eliminates (finite, strict) generalized imaginaries if every concrete groupoid (with finite automorphism groups, with one isomorphism class) ${\mathcal{G}}$ is equivalent to a canonical one.
Definition 2.2. Let $N$ be a structure, $M$ the union of some of the sorts of $N$. $N$ is a finite internal cover of $M$ if $M$ is stably embedded in $N$, and $Aut(N/M)$ is finite (uniformly in elementary extensions.) Equivalently, $N\subseteq dcl(M,b)$ for some finite $b\in acl(M)$.
Definition 2.12. A finite internal cover $T^{\prime}$ of $T$ is almost split if whenver $N^{\prime}\models T^{\prime}$, with $N$ the restriction to the sorts of $T$, for some finite $0$-definable set $C$ of imaginaries of $N^{\prime}$, $N^{\prime}\subseteq dcl(N\cup C)$. If $Aut(N^{\prime}/C)\to Aut(N)$ can be chosen to be surjective, we say that the cover is split.
Definition 4.1. Let ${\mathbf{t}}$ be a theory of fields (possibly with additional structure.) A ${\mathbf{t}}$-linear structure ${\mathsf{A}}$ is a structure with a sort $\mathbf{k}$ for a model of ${\mathbf{t}}$, and additional sorts $V_{i}$ ($i\in I=I({\mathsf{A}})$) denoting finite-dimensional vector spaces. Each $V_{i}$ has (at least) a $\mathbf{k}$-vector space structure, and $\dim_{i}V_{i}<\infty$. We assume: (1) $\mathbf{k}$ is stably embedded, (2) the induced structure on $\mathbf{k}$ is precisely given by ${\mathbf{t}}$ (3) the $V_{i}$ are closed under tensor products and duals.
Definition 6.2. Let $H=\operatorname{Stab}_{\bar{G}}x$, and $Y$ — a finite-dimensional representation of $H$. Then we denote by $\mathcal{O}_{n[Gx],Y}$ the ${\bar{G}}$-equivariant sheaf supported on the orbit $Gx$ and whose stalk at $x$ is isomorphic as an $H$-module to $Y\otimes(\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^{1},x}/m_{x}^{n})$.
Definition 8.2. Let $q_{1},q_{2}\in{\widehat{Q}}$. We say that $q_{1}$ is a predecessor of $q_{2}$ (notation: $q_{1}\prec q_{2}$) if there exists a path $q_{1}\to\bullet\to\dots\to\bullet\to q_{2}$ in ${\widehat{Q}}$. In this case, we also say that $q_{2}$ is a successor of $q_{1}$ and write $q_{2}\succ q_{1}$.
Definition 2.2. Let $h$ be a height function on $Q$, and $i\in I$ be a sink in $Q_{h}$: there are no edges of the form $i\to j$ (in terms of $h$, it is equivalent to saying that $h$ has a local minimum at $i$). We define new height function $s_{i}^{+}h(j)=\begin{cases}h(j)+2,&j=i\\ h(j),&j\neq{\mathrm{i}}\end{cases}$ Similarly, if $i$ is a source, i.e., there are no vertices of the form $j\to i$ (equivalently, $h$ has a local maximum at $i$), then we define $s_{i}^{-}h(j)=\begin{cases}h(j)-2,&j=i\\ h(j),&j\neq{\mathrm{i}}\end{cases}$
Definition 2.1. A height function $h$ is a map $I\to\mathbb{Z}$ such that $h(i)-h(j)=\pm 1$ if $i,j$ are connected by an edge in $Q$, and $h(i)\equiv p(i)\pmod{2}$.
Definition 5.4. Let $H,K$ be normal subgroups of $G$ that centralize each other, and let $B:K\times H\rightarrow k^{\times}$ be a function. We say that $B$ is an $\omega$-bicharacter if $\displaystyle\mbox{(i) }B(x,yz)$ $\displaystyle=$ $\displaystyle\beta_{x}^{-1}(y,z)B(x,y)B(x,z)\ \mbox{ and}$ $\displaystyle\mbox{(ii) }B(wx,y)$ $\displaystyle=$ $\displaystyle\beta_{y}(w,x)B(w,y)B(x,y)$ for all $w,x\in K$, $y,z\in H$. Equivalently, $B(x,\cdot)$ is a $\beta_{x}$-character of $H$ and $B(-,y)$ is a $\beta_{y}^{-1}$-character of $K$. We say that $B$ is $G$-invariant if $B(x^{-1}kx,h)=\frac{\beta_{k}(x,h)\beta_{k}(xh,x^{-1})}{\beta_{k}(x,x^{-1})}B(% k,xhx^{-1})$ for all $x,y\in G$, $h\in H$, $k\in K$.
Definition 2.5. The space $\Gamma_{C}(D,B)$ of core sections is the image of the map (2.3).
Definition 3.4. A $\mathcal{VB}$–algebroid is a DVB as in (3.1), equipped with a Lie algebroid structure on $D\to E$ such that the anchor map $\rho_{D}:D\to TE$ is a bundle morphism over $A\to TM$ and where the bracket $[\cdot,\cdot]_{D}$ is such that (1) $[\Gamma_{\ell}(D,E),\Gamma_{\ell}(D,E)]_{D}\subseteq\Gamma_{\ell}(D,E)$, (2) $[\Gamma_{\ell}(D,E),\Gamma_{C}(D,E)]_{D}\subseteq\Gamma_{C}(D,E)$, (3) $[\Gamma_{C}(D,E),\Gamma_{C}(D,E)]_{D}=0$.
Definition 2.2. A double vector bundle(DVB) is a commutative square (2.1), where all four sides are vector bundles, satisfying the conditions of Proposition 2.1.
Definition 6.2. We say that a $\mathcal{VB}$–algebroid is of type 1 when the core-anchor $\partial$ is an isomorphism of vector bundles.
Definition 4.2. The core-anchor $\partial$ of a $\mathcal{VB}$–algebroid (3.1) is minus the vector bundle morphism induced by the anchor map $\rho_{D}$ from the core $C$ of $D$ to the core $E$ of $TE$.
Definition 2.9. A horizontal lift of $A$ in $D$ is a section $h:A\to\widehat{A}$ of the short exact sequence (2.6).
Definition 2.4. A section $X\in\Gamma(D,B)$ is linear if $X$ is a bundle morphism from $B\to M$ to $D\to A$. The space of linear sections is denoted as $\Gamma_{\ell}(D,B)$.
Definition 6.1. A $\mathcal{VB}$–algebroid is called regular when the core-anchor $\partial:C\to E$ has constant rank.
Definition 3.2. An $\mathcal{LA}$–vector bundle is a DVB (3.1) equipped with a $q$-projectible Lie algebroid structure on $D\to E$ such that the addition map $+_{A}:D\times_{A}D\to D$ is an algebroid morphism.
Definition 6.4. We say that a $\mathcal{VB}$–algebroid is of type 0 when the core anchor is zero.
Definition 4.7. An $A$-superconnection on $\mathcal{E}$ is an odd operator $\mathcal{D}$ on $\Omega(A)\otimes\Gamma(\mathcal{E})$ such that $\mathcal{D}(\omega s)=(d_{A}\omega)s+(-1)^{p}\omega\wedge\mathcal{D}(s)$ for all $\omega\in\Omega(A)$ and $s\in\Gamma(\mathcal{E})$. We say that $\mathcal{D}$ is flat if the curvature $\mathcal{D}^{2}$ is zero.
Definition 0.1 Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a category. A sieve $S$ on an object $a\in{\mathcal{C}}$ consists of a set of arrows in $\mathcal{C}$ all having codomain $a$ and closed under precomposition (i.e., if $f:b\to a$ and $g:c\to b$ are arrows in $\mathcal{C}$ and $f$ belongs to $S$, then so does $fg$). We call the set $M_{a}$ of all arrows into $a$ the maximal sieve on $a$. If $S$ is a sieve on $a$ and $f:b\to a$ is any map in $\mathcal{C}$, we write $f^{*}S$ for the sieve $\{g:c\to b\,:\,fg\in S\}$ on $b$. In case $f$ belongs to $S$, we have $f^{*}S=M_{b}$. A (Grothendieck) topology Cov on $\mathcal{C}$ is given by assigning to every object $a\in{\mathcal{C}}$ a collection of sieves ${\rm Cov}(a)$ such that the following axioms are satisfied: (Maximal sieve) The maximal sieve $M_{a}$ belongs to ${\rm Cov}(a)$; (Stability) If $f:b\to a$ is any map and $S$ belongs to ${\rm Cov}(a)$, then $f^{*}S$ belongs to ${\rm Cov}(b)$; (Local character) If $S$ is a sieve on $a$ for which there can be found a sieve $R\in{\rm Cov}(a)$ such that for all $f:b\to a\in R$ the sieve $f^{*}S$ belongs to ${\rm Cov}(b)$, then $S$ belongs to ${\rm Cov}(a)$. A pair $({\mathcal{C}},{\rm Cov})$ consisting of a category ${\mathcal{C}}$ and a topology Cov on it is called a site. If a site $({\mathcal{C}},{\rm Cov})$ has been fixed, we call the sieves belonging to some ${\rm Cov}(a)$ covering sieves. If $S$ belongs to ${\rm Cov}(a)$ we say that $S$ is a sieve covering $a$, or that $a$ is covered by $S$.
Definition 2.1. ([L1, §1.1]) A based ring is a pair $(R,B)$ where $R$ is a ring, $B$ is a basis of $R$ over ${\mathbb{Z}}$ such that (i) All structure constants of $R$ with respect to basis $B$ are nonnegative integers; (ii) There exists a subset $B_{0}\subset B$ such that $1=\sum_{b\in B_{0}}b$; (iii) Let $\tau:R\to{\mathbb{Z}}$ be the group homomorphism such that its restriction to $B\subset R$ is the characteristic function of the subset $B_{0}\subset B$. There exists an anti-involution $r\mapsto\tilde{r}$ of the ring $R$ which preserves the subset $B$ and such that $\tau(bb^{\prime})=0$ for $b^{\prime}\in B\setminus\{\tilde{b}\}$ and $\tau(b\tilde{b})=1$ for any $b\in B$.
Definition 1.1. An algebraic integer $\alpha$ is called a $d-$number if the ideal it generates in the ring of algebraic integers is invariant under the action of the absolute Galois group $Gal(\bar{\mathbb{Q}}/{\mathbb{Q}})$.
Definition 3.1. A triangulated category $\mathcal{T}$ with arbitrary coproducts is called locally well generated if $\mathrm{Loc}\,\mathcal{S}$ is well generated for any set $\mathcal{S}$ of objects of $\mathcal{T}$.
Definition 2.1. An additive category $\mathcal{B}$ with arbitrary coproducts is called pure semisimple if it has an additive generator. That is, there is an object $X\in\mathcal{B}$ such that $\mathcal{B}=\mathrm{Add}X$, where $\mathrm{Add}X$ stands for the full subcategory formed by all objects which are summands in (possibly infinite) coproducts of copies of $X$.
Definition 2.4. Let $\mathcal{B}$ be an additive category. Then an additive category $\bar{\mathcal{B}}$ is called an idempotent completion of $\mathcal{B}$ if (1) $\bar{\mathcal{B}}$ has splitting idempotents; (2) $\mathcal{B}$ is a full subcategory of $\bar{\mathcal{B}}$; (3) Every object in $\bar{\mathcal{B}}$ is a direct summand of an object in $\mathcal{B}$.
Definition 3.2. Let $\mathcal{A}$ be a skeletally small additive category and $M\in\hbox{\rm Mod-}\!\mathcal{A}$. Recall that $M$ is a contravariant additive functor $\mathcal{A}\to\mathrm{Ab}$ by definition. Then the cardinality of $M$, denoted by $|M|$, is defined as $|M|=\sum_{A\in\mathcal{S}}|M(A)|,$ where $|M(A)|$ is just the usual cardinality of the group $M(A)$ and $\mathcal{S}$ is a fixed representative set for isomorphism classes of objects from $\mathcal{A}$. The cardinality of a complex ${Y}=(Y^{n},d^{n})\in\mathbf{K}(\hbox{\rm Mod-}\!\mathcal{A})$ is defined as $|{Y}|=\sum_{n\in\mathbb{Z}}|Y^{n}|.$
Definition 1.1. Let $\mathcal{T}$ be a triangulated category with arbitrary coproducts and $\kappa$ be a regular cardinal. Then $\mathcal{T}$ is called $\kappa$–well generated provided there is a set $\mathcal{S}$ of objects of $\mathcal{T}$ satisfying the following conditions: (1) If $X\in\mathcal{T}$ such that $\mathcal{T}(Y,X)=0$ for each $Y\in\mathcal{S}$, then $X=0$; (2) Each object $Y\in\mathcal{S}$ is $\kappa$–small; (3) For any morphism in $\mathcal{T}$ of the form $f:Y\to\coprod_{i\in I}X_{i}$ with $Y\in\mathcal{S}$, there exists a family of morphisms $f_{i}:Y_{i}\to X_{i}$ such that $Y_{i}\in\mathcal{S}$ for each $i\in I$ and $f$ factorizes as $Y\xrightarrow{\phantom{\coprod f_{i}}}\coprod_{i\in I}Y_{i}\xrightarrow{% \coprod f_{i}}\coprod_{i\in I}X_{i}.$ The category $\mathcal{T}$ is called well generated if it is $\kappa$–well generated for some regular cardinal $\kappa$.
