Definition 3.2. Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a braided finite tensor category with braiding $\sigma$. An object $T\in\mathcal{C}$ is transparent if $\sigma_{X,T}\sigma_{T,X}=\mathrm{id}_{T\otimes X}$ for all objects $X\in\mathcal{C}$. We define the Müger center of $\mathcal{C}$ to be the full subcategory $\mathcal{C}^{\prime}\subset\mathcal{C}$ consisting of all transparent objects of $\mathcal{C}$. We say that the Müger center of $\mathcal{C}$ is trivial if every object of $\mathcal{C}^{\prime}$ is isomorphic to the direct sum of finitely many copies of the tensor unit of $\mathcal{C}$.
Definition 2.2. Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a braided finite tensor category with braiding $\sigma$, and let $\mathbb{F}$ be as above. We define $\omega:\mathbb{F}\otimes\mathbb{F}\to\mathbb{F}$ to be the unique morphism such that, for all objects $X,Y\in\mathcal{C}$, the following equation holds: $\omega\circ(i_{X}\otimes\iota_{Y})=(\mathrm{eval}_{X}\otimes\mathrm{eval}_{Y})% \circ(\mathrm{id}_{X^{*}}\otimes\sigma_{Y^{*},X}\sigma_{X,Y^{*}}\otimes\mathrm% {id}_{Y}).$ The braided finite tensor category $\mathcal{C}$ is non-degenerate if $\omega$ is non-degenerate in the sense that the composition $\mathbb{F}=\mathbb{F}\otimes\mathbbm{1}\xrightarrow{\quad\mathrm{id}\otimes% \mathrm{coev}\quad}\mathbb{F}\otimes\mathbb{F}\otimes\mathbb{F}^{*}% \xrightarrow{\quad\omega\otimes\mathrm{id}\quad}\mathbbm{1}\otimes\mathbb{F}^{% *}=\mathbb{F}^{*}$ is an isomorphism in $\mathcal{C}$. A modular tensor category is a non-degenerate braided finite tensor category equipped with a twist.
Definition 2.1. A finite tensor category [EO04] is a rigid monoidal category $\mathcal{C}$ such that $\mathcal{C}$ is a finite abelian category, the tensor product of $\mathcal{C}$ is $k$-bilinear, and the tensor unit of $\mathcal{C}$ is a simple object. A fusion category [ENO05] is a synonym for a semisimple finite tensor category.
Definition 3.3. Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a braided finite tensor category. We say that $\mathcal{C}$ is weakly-factorizable if the map $\Phi_{\mathcal{C}}$, given by (2.6), is bijective (cf. Takeuchi [Tak01]; see also Remark 3.6 below).
Definition 3.1 (Etingof-Nikshych-Ostrik [ENO04]). Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a braided finite tensor category with braiding $\sigma$. We define $G:\mathcal{C}\boxtimes\mathcal{C}\to\mathcal{Z}(\mathcal{C})$ by the composition $\mathcal{C}\boxtimes\mathcal{C}\xrightarrow{\quad T_{+}\boxtimes T_{-}\quad}% \mathcal{Z}(\mathcal{C})\boxtimes\mathcal{Z}(\mathcal{C})\xrightarrow{\quad% \text{the tensor product}\quad}\mathcal{Z}(\mathcal{C}),$ where $T_{+}(X)=(X,\sigma_{X,\,?})$ and $T_{-}(X)=(X,\sigma_{?,X}^{-1})$. We say that $\mathcal{C}$ is factorizable if the functor $G$ is an equivalence.
Definition 3.3. The class of all left $R$-modules simply right obtainable from a given class $\mathsf{E}\subset R{\operatorname{\mathsf{--mod}}}$ is defined as the (obviously, unique) minimal class of left $R$-modules containing $\mathsf{E}$ and closed under the operations of the passage to a direct summand, an extension, the cokernel of an injective morphism, an infinite product, or a transfinitely iterated extension in the sense of the projective limit.
Definition 5.18. Let $R$ be a commutative ring and $r\in R$ be an element. An $r$-contramodule $R$-module is called quotseparated if it is a quotient $R$-module of an $r$-separated $r$-contramodule $R$-module. We denote the full subcatgory of quotseparated $r$-contramodule $R$-modules by $R{\operatorname{\mathsf{--mod}}}_{r{\operatorname{\mathsf{-ctra}}}}^{\mathsf{% qs}}\subset R{\operatorname{\mathsf{--mod}}}_{r{\operatorname{\mathsf{-ctra}}}}$.
Definition 6.2. The pair of classes of left $R$-modules right $1$-obtainable and right $2$-obtainable from a given class $\mathsf{E}\subset R{\operatorname{\mathsf{--mod}}}$ is defined as the (obviously, unique) minimal pair of classes of left $R$-modules satisfying the following generation rules: (i) all the $R$-modules from $\mathsf{E}$ are right $1$-obtainable; all the right $1$-obtainable $R$-modules are right $2$-obtainable; (ii) all the $R$-modules simply right obtainable (in the sense of Definition 3.3) from right $1$-obtainable $R$-modules are right $1$-obtainable; all the $R$-modules simply right obtainable from right $2$-obtainable $R$-modules are right $2$-obtainable; (iii) the kernel of any surjective morphism from a right $2$-obtainable $R$-module to a right $1$-obtainable $R$-module is right $2$-obtainable; (iv) the cokernel of any injective morphism from a right $2$-obtainable $R$-module to a right $1$-obtainable $R$-module is right $1$-obtainable.
Definition 3.5. The class of all left $R$-modules simply left obtainable from a given class $\mathsf{M}\subset R{\operatorname{\mathsf{--mod}}}$ is defined as the (obviously, unique) minimal class of left $R$-modules containing $\mathsf{M}$ and closed under the operations of the passage to a direct summand, an extension, the kernel of a surjective morphism, an infinite direct sum, or a transfinitely iterated extension in the sense of the inductive limit.
Definition 7.1. A Feynman algebra is an algebra over the PROP $\mathscr{F}$. Equivalently, it is a symmetric monoidal functor $Z\colon\mathscr{F}\to\mathsf{Vect}\,,$ where $\mathsf{Vect}$ denotes the category of $\mathbb{C}$-vector spaces. The morphism $Z$ is called graphical calculus; the operator $Z(\Gamma)$ corresponding to a Feynman diagram $\Gamma$ is called amplitude of the diagram6By abuse of notation we will write $Z(\Gamma)$ for $Z([\Gamma])$..
Definition 5.1. Let $n$ be a natural number. A Feynman diagram with $n$ legs is the following set of data: (1) a 1-dimensional CW-complex $\Gamma$; (2) $n$ distinguished 1-valent vertices of $\Gamma$, called the endpoints of $\Gamma$; the vertices of $\Gamma$ which are not endpoints will be called internal vertices. The germs of the edges stemming from the endpoints are called legs of the diagram and are denoted by $\text{Legs}(\Gamma)$; any edge which does not end in an endpoint will be called an internal edge of the diagram; (3) a map $\text{Internal vertices}(\Gamma)\to\text{\sf Co}\cup\text{\sf Cy}\cup\text{\sf Sy}\,$ called decoration; (4) elements in the pre-image of $\sf Co$ are the coupon vertices; for any coupon vertex $v$ of $\Gamma$, a splitting of the set $\operatorname{Legs}(v)$ — i.e., germs of edges stemming from $v$ — into two totally ordered subsets denoted $\operatorname{In}(v)$ and $\operatorname{Out}(v)$ respectively. A coupon vertex decorated by the colour $\alpha$ is depicted by $\xy*!LC\xybox{(0,1)*+[F]{\alpha};(-.8,0)**\dir{-},(-0.4,0)**\dir{-},(0.2,0.1)*% +{\ldots},(.8,0)**\dir{-},(-.8,2)**\dir{-},(-0.4,2)**\dir{-},(0.2,1.8)*+{% \ldots},(.8,2)**\dir{-}}\endxy\,,$ with inputs on the lower side and outputs on the upper side, the total order being that induced by the horizontal coordinate in the plane; (5) elements in the pre-image of $\sf Cy$ are the cyclic vertices; for any cyclic vertex $v$ of $\Gamma$, a cyclic order on the set $\operatorname{Legs}(v)$. A cyclic vertex decorated by the colour $\beta$ is depicted by $\xy*!LC\xybox{\POS*+{\displaystyle\scriptstyle{\beta}}*\cir{}="CENTER",\POS{% \xypolygon 7"VERTEX"{~{}:{R:}~{}<{-}~{}>{}}\xypolygon 7"AUXi"{~{}:{(0.75,0):}~% {}>{}}\xypolygon 7"AUXii"{~{}:{(1.3,0):}~{}>{}}}\POS{"VERTEX1";"AUXii1"**\dir{% -},}\POS{"VERTEX2";"AUXii2"**\dir{-},}\POS{"VERTEX3";"AUXii3"**\dir{-},}\POS{"% VERTEX4";"AUXii4"**\dir{-},}\POS{0;"AUXi5"**\dir{}?(.9)*{\displaystyle{\cdots}% }}\POS{"VERTEX6";"AUXii6"**\dir{-},}\POS{"VERTEX7";"AUXii7"**\dir{-},}}\endxy\,,$ the cyclic order being that inherited by the standard counterclockwise orientation on the plane; (6) elements in the pre-image of $\sf Sy$ are the symmetric vertices; no additional combinatorial constraints are imposed on a symmetric vertex; a symmetric vertex decorated by the colour $\gamma$ is depicted by $\xy*!LC\xybox{\POS*{\displaystyle\bullet}="CENTER",\POS{\xypolygon 7"VERTEX"{~% {}:{R:}~{}<{-}~{}>{}}\xypolygon 7"AUXi"{~{}:{(0.75,0):}~{}>{}}\xypolygon 7"% AUXii"{~{}:{(1.3,0):}~{}>{}}}\POS{"VERTEX1";"AUXii1"**\dir{-},}\POS{"VERTEX2";% "AUXii2"**\dir{-},}\POS{"VERTEX3";"AUXii3"**\dir{-},}\POS{"VERTEX4";"AUXii4"**% \dir{-},}\POS{0;"AUXi5"**\dir{}?(.9)*{\displaystyle{\cdots}}}\POS{"VERTEX6";"% AUXii6"**\dir{-},}\POS{"VERTEX7";"AUXii7"**\dir{-},}},(1.1,0.3)*{\scriptstyle{% \gamma}}\endxy$ The set of colours are split into the two disjoint subsets of ordinary and special colours. A vertex will be called ordinary or special depending on the colour decorating it. Moreover, an injective map from ordinary to special colours is given and, for any valence $d$, the set of colours decorating $d$-valent ordinary vertices is finite. Isomorphisms between Feynman diagrams are homotopy classes of cellular isomorphisms of the underlying CW-complexes, respecting the additional structures on the vertices.
Definition 6.1. Let $\Gamma\in\mathsf{F}(n)$ be a Feynman diagram with $n$ legs. We say that $\Gamma$ is a sub-diagram of the Feynman diagram $\Psi\in\mathsf{F}(m)$ if there is an isomorphism of Feynman diagrams $\hat{\Psi}\simeq\hat{\Gamma}\circ\hat{\Phi}$ for a suitable pre-image $\hat{\Gamma}$ of $\Gamma$ in $\mathsf{F}(n,0)$, a suitable pre-image $\hat{\Psi}$ of $\Psi$ in $\mathsf{F}(m,0)$ and some Feynman diagram $\hat{\Phi}\in\mathsf{F}(m,n)$.
Definition 3.2. Let $\pi\colon\mathsf{A}\to\mathsf{B}$ be a finite covering of discrete groupoids with finite homs, and let $\varphi\colon\mathsf{A}\to V$ be an integrable morphism. The push-forward of $\varphi$ is the morphism $\pi_{*}\varphi\colon\mathsf{B}\to V$ defined by $(\pi_{*}\varphi)(y)=\sum_{x\in{\rm Ob}\left((\pi^{-1}({\bf y})\right)}\varphi(x)$
Definition 5.2. Let $n$ and $m$ be two natural numbers. A Feynman diagram of type $(n,m)$ is the following set of data: (1) a Feynman diagram $\Gamma$ with $(m+n)$ legs; (2) a splitting of $\text{Endpoints}(\Gamma)$ into two subsets $\operatorname{In}(\Gamma)$ and $\operatorname{Out}(\Gamma)$, of cardinality $n$ and $m$ respectively. The set $\operatorname{In}(\Gamma)$ is called the set of the inputs of $\Gamma$ and the set $\operatorname{Out}(\Gamma)$ is called the set of the outputs of $\Gamma$; (3) two bijections $\displaystyle\iota_{\Gamma}\colon\{1_{\text{in}},\dots,n_{\text{in}}\}$ $\displaystyle\to\operatorname{In}(\Gamma)$ $\displaystyle\omega_{\Gamma}\colon\{1_{\text{out}},\dots,m_{\text{out}}\}$ $\displaystyle\to\operatorname{Out}(\Gamma)$ inducing total orders on $\operatorname{In}(\Gamma)$ and $\operatorname{Out}(\Gamma)$.
Definition 3.1. Let ${\sf A}\simeq\coprod_{n}{\sf A}_{n}$ be a discrete groupoid with finite homs and graded objects, such that the coarse spaces $\{{\mathcal{A}}_{n}\}$ are finite sets and let $V$ be a topological module over a topological commutative $\mathbb{C}$-algebra $R$. We say that a morphism $\varphi\colon\mathsf{A}\to V$ is integrable if the series $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\left(\sum_{[x]\in{\mathcal{A}}_{n}}\frac{\varphi(x)}{% \lvert\operatorname{Aut}x\rvert}\right)$ is convergent. If so, we write $\int_{\mathcal{A}}\varphi\,\mathrm{d}\mu_{\mathcal{A}}=\sum_{[x]\in\mathcal{A}% }\frac{\varphi(x)}{\lvert\operatorname{Aut}x\rvert}$
Definition 6.2. Let $\Gamma$ be a Feynman diagram. The groupoid $\mathsf{F}_{\Gamma}$ is the subgroupoid of $\mathsf{F}$ whose objects are the Feynman diagrams $\Psi$ such that (1) $\Gamma$ is a distinguished sub-diagram of $\Psi$; (2) all the vertices of $\Psi$ outside $\Gamma$ are ordinary; Morphisms between objects of $\mathsf{F}_{\Gamma}$ are the morphisms in $\mathsf{F}$ which map the distinguished sub-diagram $\Gamma$ to itself.
Definition 2.5 A double category $D$ consists of the following: (1) A category $D_{0}$ of objects $Obj(D_{0})$ and morphisms $Mor(D_{0})$ of $0$-level. (2) A category $D_{1}$ of morphisms $Obj(D_{1})$ of $1$-level and morphisms $Mor(D_{1})$ of $2$-level. (3) Two functors $d,r:D_{1}\overrightarrow{\to}D_{0}.$ (4) A composition functor $\ast:D_{1}\times_{D_{0}}D_{1}\to D_{1}$ where the bundle product is defined by commutative diagram $\begin{array}[]{ccc}D_{1}\times_{D_{0}}D_{1}&\underrightarrow{\pi_{2}}&D_{1}\\ \pi_{1}\downarrow&&\quad\downarrow d\\ D_{1}&\underrightarrow{r}&D_{0}\end{array}$ (5) A unit functor $ID:D_{0}\to D_{1}$, which is a section of $d,r$.
Definition 5.1 We will say that a category ${\bf{C}}$ is a category of information transformers over a subcategory (of deterministic ITs) ${\bf{D}}$ if the following three axioms hold.
Definition 2.1 We tell that a functor $F:{\cal C}\to{\cal C}^{\prime}$ define a additional ${\cal C}-$structure on objects of the category ${\cal C}^{\prime}$ if 1. $\forall X,Y\in Ob({\cal C})$ the map $F:{\cal C}(X,Y)\to{\cal C}^{\prime}(F(X),F(Y))$ is injective, 2. $\forall X\in Ob({\cal C}),Y\in Ob({\cal C}^{\prime})$ and an isomorphism $u:Y\to F(X)$ there is an object $\tilde{Y}\in Ob$ and an isomorphism $\tilde{u}:\tilde{Y}\to X$ such that $F(\tilde{Y})=Y$ and $F(\tilde{u})=u$. Such functor is called a forgetful functor.
Definition 3.1 A multiplication in the category ${\cal C}$ is an associative functor $\ast:{\cal C}\times{\cal C}\to{\cal C}:(X,Y)\mapsto X*Y.$ An associativity morphism for $*$ is a functor isomorphism $\varphi_{X,Y,Z}:X*(Y*Z)\to(X*Y)*Z$ such that for any four objects $X,Y,Z,T$ the following diagram is commutative: $\begin{array}[]{ccccc}{X*(Y*(Z*T))}&\overset{\varphi_{X,Y,Z*T}}{% \longrightarrow}&{(X*Y)*(Z*T)}&\overset{\varphi_{X*Y,Z,T}}{\longrightarrow}&{X% *Y*Z*T}\\ {{\quad\quad\quad\;\downarrow id_{X}*\varphi_{Y,Z,T}}}&&&&{{}{}{}{\quad\quad% \quad\;\uparrow\varphi_{X,Y,Z}*id_{T}}}\\ {X*((Y*Z)*T)}&&\overset{\varphi_{X,Y*Z,T}}{\longrightarrow}&&{(X*(Y*Z))*T}\end% {array}$ $\begin{CD}{X*(Y*(Z*T))}@>{\varphi_{X,Y,Z*T}}>{}>{(X*Y)*(Z*T)}@>{\varphi_{X*Y,Z% ,T}}>{}>{X*Y*Z*T}\\ @V{id_{X}*\varphi_{Y,Z,T}}V{}V@A{}A{\varphi_{X,Y,Z}*id_{T}}A\\ {X*((Y*Z)*T)}@>{\varphi_{X,Y*Z,T}}>{}>{(X*(Y*Z))*T}\end{CD}$ An commutativity morphism for $*$ is a functor isomorphism $\psi_{X,Y}:X*Y\to Y*X$ such that for any two objects $X,Y$ we have $\varphi_{X,Y}\circ\varphi_{Y,X}=id_{X*Y}:X*Y\to X*Y.$ Morphisms associativity $\varphi$ and commutativity $\psi$ are compatible if for any three objects $X,Y,Z$ the following diagram is commutative: $\begin{array}[]{ccccc}{X*(Y*Z)}&\overset{\varphi_{X,Y,Z}}{\longrightarrow}&{(X% *Y)*Z}&\overset{\psi_{X*Y,Z}}{\longrightarrow}&{Z*(X*Y)}\\ {{\quad\quad\quad\;\downarrow id_{X}*\psi_{Y,Z}}}&&&&{{}{}{}{\quad\quad\quad\;% \uparrow\varphi_{Z,X,Y}}}\\ {X*(Z*Y)}&\overset{\varphi_{X,Z,Y}}{\longrightarrow}&{(X*Z)*Y}&\overset{\psi_{% X,Z}*id_{Y}}{\longrightarrow}&{(Z*X)*Y}\end{array}$ $\begin{CD}{X*(Y*Z)}\overset{\varphi_{X,Y,Z}}{\longrightarrow}{(X*Y)*Z}\overset% {\psi_{X*Y,Z}}{\longrightarrow}{Z*(X*Y)}\\ {{\quad\quad\quad\;\downarrow id_{X}*\psi_{Y,Z}}}{{}{}{}{\quad\quad\quad\;% \uparrow\varphi_{Z,X,Y}}}\\ {X*(Z*Y)}\overset{\varphi_{X,Z,Y}}{\longrightarrow}{(X*Z)*Y}\overset{\psi_{X,Z% }*id_{Y}}{\longrightarrow}{(Z*X)*Y}\end{CD}$ A pair $(U,u)$ where $U\in Obj({\cal C})$ and an isomorphism $u:U\to U*U$ is called a unit object for ${\cal C},*$ if the functor $X\mapsto U*X:{\cal C}\to{\cal C}$ is equivalence of categories.
Definition 7.2 We shall say that an information transformer $a$ is more informative (better) than $b$ if there exists an information transformer $c$ such that $c\circ a\vartriangleright b$, that is, $a\succcurlyeq b\;\buildrel{\rm def}\over{\iff}\;\exists c\hskip 7.0ptc\circ a% \vartriangleright b.$
Definition 2.3 Let $M,M^{\prime},M^{\prime\prime}\in{\cal M}.$ A map $\Phi:M\to{\cal M}(M^{\prime},M^{\prime\prime}):x\mapsto\Phi_{x}$ is called a smooth family of morphisms if there exists a smooth map $\phi:M\times M^{\prime}\to M^{\prime\prime}$ such that $\forall x\in M,\ x^{\prime}\in M^{\prime}\quad\Phi_{x}(x^{\prime})=\phi(x,x^{% \prime}).$
Definition 1.3 Let $F:{\bf X}\rightarrow{\bf Y}$ and $G:{\bf X}\rightarrow{\bf Y}$ be two functors. A natural transformation $\alpha:F\rightarrow G$ is given by the following data. For every object $A$ in ${\bf X}$ there is a morphism $\alpha_{A}:F(A)\rightarrow G(A)$ in ${\bf Y}$ such that for every morphism $f:A\rightarrow B$ in ${\bf X}$ the following diagram is commutative $\begin{array}[]{ccc}{F(A)}&\overset{\alpha_{A}}{\longrightarrow}&{G(A)}\\ {F(f)\downarrow}&&{{\;}{\;\downarrow G(f)}}\\ {F(B)}&\overset{\alpha_{B}}{\longrightarrow}&{G(B)}.\\ \end{array}$
Definition 1.1 A category is a quadruple $(\mathop{{\rm Ob}}\nolimits,{\rm Hom},{\rm id},\circ)$ consisting of: (Cl) a class $\mathop{{\rm Ob}}\nolimits$ of objects; (C2) for each ordered pair $(A,B)$ of objects a set ${\rm Hom}(A,B)$ of morphisms; (C3) for each object $A$ a morphism ${\rm id}_{A}\in{\rm Hom}(A,A)$, the identity of $A$; (C4) a composition law associating to each pair of morphisms $f\in{\rm Hom}(A,B)$ and $g\in{\rm Hom}(B,C)$ a morphism $g\circ f\in{\rm Hom}(A,C)$; which is such that: (Ml) $h\circ(g\circ f)=(h\circ g)\circ f$ for all $f\in{\rm Hom}(A,B)$, $g\in{\rm Hom}(B,C)$ and $h\in{\rm Hom}(C,D)$; (M2) ${\rm id}_{B}\circ f=f\circ{\rm id}_{A}=f$ for all $f\in Hom(A,B)$; (M3) the sets ${\rm Hom}(A,B)$ are pairwise disjoint.
Definition 7.1 We will say that $\vartriangleright$ is an accuracy relation on an IT-category ${\bf{C}}$ if for any pair of objects ${\cal A}$ and ${\cal B}$ in ${\bf{C}}$ the set ${\bf{C}}({\cal A},{\cal B})$ of all ITs from ${\cal A}$ to ${\cal B}$ is equipped with a partial order $\vartriangleright$ that satisfies the following monotonicity conditions: $a\vartriangleright a^{\prime},\;b\vartriangleright b^{\prime}\;\;% \Longrightarrow\;\;a\circ b\vartriangleright a^{\prime}\circ b^{\prime},$ $a\vartriangleright a^{\prime},\;b\vartriangleright b^{\prime}\;\;% \Longrightarrow\;\;a*b\vartriangleright a^{\prime}*b^{\prime}.$
Definition 2.2 A structure defined by a forgetful functor $f:{\cal C}\to Top$ is called a local structure if $\forall C\in Obj({\cal C})$ and any inclusion map $i:U\to f(C)$ of the open subset $U$ an object $\tilde{U}\in Ob({\cal C})$ and a morphism $\tilde{i}\in{\cal C}(\tilde{U},C)$ exist such that $f(\tilde{U})=U$ $f(\tilde{i})=i.$ This ${\cal C}-$structure $\tilde{U}$ is denoted by $C|U$ and called a restriction of $C$ on $U$.
Definition 3.2 A multiplicative category is a collection $({\cal C},*,\varphi,\psi,U,u).$
Definition 2.6 A double category functor $F:D\rightarrow D^{\prime}$ is a pair $F_{0}:D_{0}\rightarrow D_{0}^{\prime},F_{1}:D_{1}\rightarrow D_{1}^{\prime}$ of usual functors such that $\displaystyle d^{\prime}\circ F_{1}=F_{0}\circ d,\quad r^{\prime}\circ F_{1}=F% _{0}\circ r,$ $\displaystyle\forall\;\xi,\xi^{\prime}\in Obj(D_{1})\qquad\varphi_{\xi,\xi^{% \prime}}:F_{1}(\xi*\xi^{\prime})\widetilde{\rightarrow}F_{1}(\xi)*^{\prime}F_{% 1}(\xi^{\prime}),$ $\displaystyle\forall\;A\in Obj(D_{0})\qquad\varphi_{A}:F_{1}(ID_{A})\widetilde% {\rightarrow}ID_{F_{0}(A)}.$
Definition 4.1 We shall say that a category ${\bf{C}}$ is a category of information transformers if the following axioms hold: 1. There is a fixed subcategory of deterministic ITs ${\bf{D}}$ that contains all the objects of the category ${\bf{C}}$ ($\mathop{{\rm Ob}}\nolimits({\bf{D}})=\mathop{{\rm Ob}}\nolimits({\bf{C}})$). 2. The classes of isomorphisms in ${\bf{D}}$ and in ${\bf{C}}$ coincide, that is, all the isomorphisms in ${\bf{C}}$ are deterministic. 3. The categories ${\bf{D}}$ and ${\bf{C}}$ have a common terminal object ${{\cal Z}}$. 4. The category ${\bf{D}}$ has pairwise products. 5. There is a specified extension of morphism product from the subcategory ${\bf{D}}$ to the whole category ${\bf{C}}$, that is, for any object ${\cal D}$ and for any pair of morphisms $a\colon{\cal D}\to{\cal A}$ and $b\colon{\cal D}\to{\cal B}$ in ${\bf{C}}$ there is certain information transformer $a*b\colon{\cal D}\to{\cal A}\times{\cal B}$ (which is also called a product of ITs $a$ and $b$) such that $\pi_{{}_{\!\scriptstyle{\cal A},{\cal B}\!}}\circ(a*b)=a,\qquad\nu_{{}_{\!% \scriptstyle{\cal A},{\cal B}\!}}\circ(a*b)=b.$ 6. Let $a\colon{\cal A}\to{\cal C}$ and $b\colon{\cal B}\to{\cal D}$ are arbitrary ITs in ${\bf{C}}$, then the IT $a\mathbin{\mathchoice{\raise 0.86pt\hbox{$\scriptstyle\times$}}{\raise 0.86pt% \hbox{$\scriptstyle\times$}}{\raise 0.0pt\hbox{$\scriptscriptstyle\times$}}{% \raise 0.0pt\hbox{$\scriptscriptstyle\times$}}}b$ defined by Eq. (3) satisfy Eq. (5): $(a\mathbin{\mathchoice{\raise 0.86pt\hbox{$\scriptstyle\times$}}{\raise 0.86pt% \hbox{$\scriptstyle\times$}}{\raise 0.0pt\hbox{$\scriptscriptstyle\times$}}{% \raise 0.0pt\hbox{$\scriptscriptstyle\times$}}}b)\circ(c*d)=(a\circ c)*(b\circ d).$ 7. Equality (7) holds not only in ${\bf{D}}$ but in ${\bf{C}}$ as well, that is, product of information transformers is “commutative up to isomorphism.” 8. Equality (9) also holds in ${\bf{C}}$. In other words, product of information transformers is “associative up to isomorphism” too.
Definition 2.4 A functor is called a smooth functor if it maps each smooth family to a smooth family.
Definition 1.2 Let ${\bf X}$ and ${\bf Y}$ be two categories. A functor from ${\bf X}$ to ${\bf Y}$ is a family of functions $F$ which associates to each object $A$ in ${\bf X}$ an object $FA$ in ${\bf Y}$ and to each morphism $f\in{\rm Hom}_{\bf X}(A,B)$ a morphism $Ff\in{\rm Hom}_{\bf Y}(FA,FB)$, and which is such that: (FI) $F(g\circ f)=Fg\circ Ff$ for all $f\in{\rm Hom}_{\bf X}(A,B)$ and $g\in{\rm Hom}_{\bf Y}(B,C)$; (F2) $F\,{\rm id}_{A}={\rm id}_{FA}$ for all $A\in\mathop{{\rm Ob}}\nolimits({\bf X})$.
Definition 8.1 We shall say that an information transformer $a$ is semantically more informative than $b$ if for any interpretation object ${\cal U}$ and for any preorder $\gg$ (on the set of interpretable information transformers) $a\sqsupseteq b$ for the induced preorder $\sqsupseteq$.
Definition 2.4 By an involutive quantale is meant a quantale $Q$ together with an involution, ${}^{*}$, satisfying the conditions that $a^{**}=a\;,$ $(a\&b)^{*}=b^{*}\&a^{*}\;,\mbox{ and }$ $\biggl{(}\bigvee_{i}a_{i}\biggr{)}^{*}=\bigvee_{i}a_{i}^{*}$ for all $a,b,a_{i}\in Q$. By a Gelfand quantale is meant a quantale $Q$ which is unital, involutive, and which satisfies the condition $a\&a^{*}\&a=a$ for each right-sided (equivalently, left-sided) element $a\in Q$.
Definition 3.1 Let $Q$ be a quantale. We say that $Q$ is spatial with respect to a family of homomorphisms (“points”) $\{p_{i}:Q\rightarrow Q_{i}\}_{i}$ if, for all $a,b\in Q$, $a=b$ whenever $p_{i}(a)=p_{i}(b)$ for all $i$.
Definition 2.6 By a quantale homomorphism $\varphi:Q\rightarrow Q^{\prime}$ is meant a sup-lattice homomorphism which also preserves the operation of product, $\&$, of the quantales. The map is unital provided that $e^{\prime}=\varphi(e)$, where $e$ and $e^{\prime}$ are the respective units, pre-unital if $e^{\prime}\leq f(e)$,1In [15] the unital homomorphisms are what we are now calling pre-unital. and strong if $1^{\prime}=\varphi(1)$, where $1$ and $1^{\prime}$ are the respective top elements of $Q$ and $Q^{\prime}$. A homomorphism of involutive quantales is involutive if it preserves the involution. We denote various categories of quantales as follows: ${\bf Qu}$ is the category of quantales and quantale homomorphisms; by adding a subscript “$e$”, as in ${\bf Qu}_{e}$, we restrict to unital quantales and unital homomorphisms; by adding a subscript “$1$”, as in ${\bf Qu}_{1}$, we restrict to strong quantales and strong homomorphisms; by adding a superscript “$*$”, as in ${\bf Qu}^{*}$, we restrict to involutive quantales and involutive homomorphisms. (For instance, ${\bf Qu}_{e}^{*}$ is the category of unital involutive quantales with unital and involutive homomorphisms.)
Definition 3.5 Let $\{p_{i}\}_{i}$ be a family of points of a quantale $Q$. The spatialization of $Q$ with respect to $\{p_{i}\}_{i}$ is the quotient $Q/{\sim}$, where $a\sim b$ if and only if $p_{i}(a)=p_{i}(b)$ for all $i$. We denote by ${\rm Spat}_{Q}:Q\rightarrow Q/{\sim}$ the natural quotient homomorphism.
Definition 2.8 Let $Q$ be a quantale and $S$ a sup-lattice. A representation of $Q$ on $S$ is a homomorphism $r:Q\rightarrow{\cal Q}(S)$. This makes $S$ a right module over $Q$ in an obvious sense, and we write $x\cdot a$ for the action of $a\in Q$ on $x\in S$, i.e., $x\cdot a=r(a)(x)$. The representation $r$ is said to be irreducible if the only principal ideals $I\subseteq S$ which are invariant under the representation are $\{0_{S}\}$ and $S$ itself; that is, if the condition $I\cdot Q\subseteq I$ implies either $I=\{0_{S}\}$ or $I=S$.
Definition 3.2 Let $Q$ be a quantale. An element $p\in Q$ is prime if the condition $a\&1\&b\leq p$ implies $a\leq p$ or $b\leq p$, for all $a,b\in Q$.
Definition 2.5 For a noncommutative C*-algebra $A$ with identity, by the spectrum of $A$ is meant the unital involutive quantale ${\rm Max}\,A$ of all closed linear subspaces of $A$ together with the product, $\&$, defined by setting $M\&N=\overline{MN}=\overline{\{a_{1}b_{1}+\ldots+a_{n}b_{n}\mid a_{i}\in M,\ b% _{i}\in N\}}\;,$ to be the closure of the product of linear subspaces for each $M,N\in{\rm Max}\,A$, and the join, $\bigvee$, defined by taking $\bigvee_{i}M_{i}=\overline{\sum_{i}M_{i}}$ to be the closure of the sum of linear subspaces for each family $M_{i}\in{\rm Max}\,A$. The involution is calculated pointwise, $M^{*}=\{a^{*}\mid a\in M\}$, and the unit of ${\rm Max}\,A$ is given by the closed linear subspace generated by the identity of $A$.
Definition 2.1 By a quantale $Q$ is meant a sup-lattice together with an associative product, $\&$, satisfying $a\&\biggl{(}\bigvee_{i}b_{i}\biggr{)}\ =\bigvee_{i}(a\&b_{i})$ and $\biggl{(}\bigvee_{i}a_{i}\biggr{)}\&b=\bigvee_{i}(a_{i}\&b)$ for all $a,b,a_{i},b_{i}\in Q$. We always denote the bottom element $\bigvee\emptyset$ of $Q$ by $0$. The quantale $Q$ is said to be unital provided that there exists an element $e\in Q$ for which $e\&a=a=a\&e$ for all $a\in Q$. The top element of $Q$ is denoted by $1$, and a quantale whose top satisfies $1\&1=1$ is strong. A quantale $Q$ for which $0=1$ is trivial.
Definition 2.3 An element $a\in Q$ of a quantale $Q$ is said to be right-sided if $a\&1\leq a$ for all $a\in Q$. Similarly, $a\in Q$ is said to be left-sided if $1\&a\leq a$ for all $a\in Q$, and two-sided if it is both right- and left-sided. The sets of right-, left-, and two-sided elements of $Q$ are respectively denoted by $\mathrm{R}(Q)$, ${\rm L}(Q)$, and ${\rm I}(Q)$.
Definition 3.1. Let $\mathcal{H}$ be an abelian category or a triangulated category. A subcategory $\mathcal{T}$ of $\mathcal{H}$ is called a maximal $1$-orthogonal subcategory of $\mathcal{H}$, if it satisfies the following conditions: 1. $\mathcal{T}$ is contravariantly finite and covariantly finite, 2. $X\in\mathcal{T}$ if and only if $\mbox{Ext}^{1}(X,\mathcal{T})=0,$ 3. $X\in\mathcal{T}$ if and only if $\mbox{Ext}^{1}(\mathcal{T},X)=0.$ In case $\mathcal{H}$ is a triangulated category, the maximal $1$-orthogonal subcategories are called tilting subcategories. If $\mathcal{T}=addT$, we call $T$ is a maximal $1-$orthogonal object of $\mathcal{H}.$

Definition 2.5. A right module category over a tensor category $(\mathcal{C},\,\otimes,\,1_{\mathcal{C}},\,\alpha,\,\lambda,\,\rho)$ with unit object $1_{\mathcal{C}}$, associativity constraint $\alpha$, left unit constraint $\lambda$, and right unit constraint $\rho$, is a category $\mathcal{M}$ together with an exact bifunctor $\otimes:\mathcal{M}\times\mathcal{C}\to\mathcal{M}$ and functorial associativity and unit isomorphisms: $\mu_{M,\,X,\,Y}:M\otimes(X\otimes Y)\to(M\otimes X)\otimes Y,\,\,\tau_{M}:M% \otimes 1_{\mathcal{C}}\to M$ for any $X,Y\in\mathcal{C},\,M\in\mathcal{M}$ such that the following two diagrams commute. $\xymatrix{&M\otimes(X\otimes Y)\otimes Z)\ar[dl]_{\text{id}_{M}\otimes\alpha_{% X,Y,Z}}\ar[dr]^{\mu_{M,\,X\otimes Y,\,Z}}&\\ M\otimes(X\otimes(Y\otimes Z))\ar[d]^{\mu_{M,\,X,\,Y\otimes Z}}&&(M\otimes(X% \otimes Y))\otimes Z\ar[d]_{\mu_{M,\,X,\,Y}\otimes\text{id}_{Z}}\\ (M\otimes X)\otimes(Y\otimes Z)\ar[rr]^{\mu_{M\otimes X,\,Y,\,Z}}&&((M\otimes X% )\otimes Y)\otimes Z}$ $\xymatrix{M\otimes(1_{\mathcal{C}}\otimes Y)\ar[rr]^{\mu_{M,\,1_{\mathcal{C}},% \,Y}}\ar[dr]^{\text{id}_{M}\otimes\lambda_{Y}}&&(M\otimes 1_{\mathcal{C}})% \otimes Y\ar[dl]_{\tau_{M}\otimes\text{id}_{Y}}\\ &M\otimes Y&}$

Let $(F^{1},\,\gamma^{1})$ and $(F^{2},\,\gamma^{2})$ be module functors from $\mathcal{M}_{1}$ to $\mathcal{M}_{2}$. A natural module transformation from $(F^{1},\,\gamma^{1})$ to $(F^{2},\,\gamma^{2})$ is a natural transformation $\eta:F^{1}\to F^{2}$ such that the following square commutes for all $M\in\mathcal{M}$, $X\in\mathcal{C}$. $\xymatrix{F^{1}(M\otimes X)\ar[r]^{\eta_{M\otimes X}}\ar[d]_{\gamma_{M,\,X}^{1% }}&F^{2}(M\otimes X)\ar[d]^{\gamma_{M,\,X}^{2}}&\\ F^{1}(M)\otimes X\ar[r]_{\eta_{M}\otimes id_{X}}&F^{2}(M)\otimes X&}$
Definition 5.6. We say that a group $G$ is categorically Morita rigid if any group that is categorically Morita equivalent to $G$ is actually isomorphic to $G$.
Definition 2.9. The dual category of $\mathcal{C}$ with respect to $\mathcal{M}$ is the category $\mathcal{C}^{*}_{\mathcal{M}}:=Fun_{\mathcal{C}}(\mathcal{M},\mathcal{M})$ whose objects are $\mathcal{C}$-module functors from $\mathcal{M}$ to itself and morphisms are natural module transformations.
