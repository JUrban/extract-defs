Definition 1.7. Every bicategory $\mathbb{B}$ determines an ordinary category $\mathbf{Ho}(\mathbb{B})$, its classifying category, as follows [Ben67, Section 7]: The objects of $\mathbf{Ho}(\mathbb{B})$ and $\mathbb{B}$ are the same; the morphism set from $x$ to $y$ in the classifying category $\mathbf{Ho}(\mathbb{B})$ is the set of isomorphism classes of objects in the morphism category $\mathbf{Mor}_{\mathbb{B}}(x,y)$. In the notation introduced before, $\mathrm{Mor}_{\mathbf{Ho}(\mathbb{B})}(x,y)=\operatorname{Iso}(\mathbf{Mor}_{% \mathbb{B}}(x,y)).$ The associativity and identity constraints for $\mathbb{B}$ prove that horizontal composition provides $\mathbf{Ho}(\mathbb{B})$ with a the structure of an ordinary category such that the isomorphism classes of the $\operatorname{Id}(x)$ become the identities.
Definition 3.7. We define $\mathrm{E}_{2}^{0,1}$ to be the equalizer of the two homomorphisms $\mathrm{d}_{1}^{\prime}$ and $\mathrm{d}_{1}^{\prime\prime}$, this is the kernel of the difference $\mathrm{d}_{1}=\mathrm{d}_{1}^{\prime}-\mathrm{d}_{1}^{\prime\prime}$.
Definition 3.1. The canonical homomorphism (3.1) is called the characteristic homomorphsim.
Definition 3.12. We define $\mathrm{E}_{2}^{1,1}=\mathrm{Z}_{1}^{1,1}/\mathrm{B}_{1}^{1,1},$ which is also an abelian group.
Definition 2.1. Let $\mathbb{B}$ be a (small) bicategory. Its Drinfeld center $\mathbf{Z}(\mathbb{B})$ is the following ordinary category. The objects in $\mathbf{Z}(\mathbb{B})$ are pairs $(P,p)$ where $P=(P(x)\in\mathbf{Mor}_{\mathbb{B}}(x,x)\,|\,x\in\mathbb{B})$ is a family of objects in the endomorphism (tensor) categories $\mathbf{Mor}_{\mathbb{B}}(x,x)$, one for each object $x\in\mathbb{B}$, and $p=(p(M)\colon P(y)\otimes M\overset{\cong}{\longrightarrow}M\otimes P(x)\,|\,x% ,y\in\mathbb{B},M\in\mathbf{Mor}_{\mathbb{B}}(x,y))$ is a family of natural isomorphisms in $\mathbf{Mor}_{\mathbb{B}}(x,y)$, one for each object $M\in\mathbf{Mor}_{\mathbb{B}}(x,y)$. These pairs of families have to satisfy two conditions: Firstly, the isomorphism $p(\operatorname{Id}(x))\colon P(x)\otimes\operatorname{Id}(x)\to\operatorname{% Id}(x)\otimes P(x)$ is the composition of the identity constraints $\lambda$ and $\rho$. Secondly, ignoring the obvious associativity constraints, there is an equality $p(M\otimes N)=(\operatorname{id}(M)\otimes p(N))(p(M)\otimes\operatorname{id}(% N))$ that holds between morphisms in the category $\mathbf{Mor}_{\mathbb{B}}(x,z)$ for all objects $M\in\mathbf{Mor}_{\mathbb{B}}(y,z)$ and $N\in\mathbf{Mor}_{\mathbb{B}}(x,y)$ that are horizontally composeable. A morphism from $(P,p)$ to $(Q,q)$ in the category $\mathbf{Z}(\mathbb{B})$ is a family of morphisms $f(x)\colon P(x)\to Q(x)$ in the categories $\mathbf{Mor}_{\mathbb{B}}(x,x)$ such that the diagram $\xymatrix{P(y)\otimes M\ar[d]_{f(y)\otimes\operatorname{id}(M)}\ar[r]^{p(M)}&M% \otimes P(x)\ar[d]^{\operatorname{id}(M)\otimes f(x)}\\ Q(y)\otimes M\ar[r]_{q(M)}&M\otimes Q(x)}$ commutes for all objects $M\in\mathbf{Mor}_{\mathbb{B}}(x,y)$. Identities and composition in the category $\mathbf{Z}(\mathbb{B})$ are defined so that there is a faithful functor $\mathbf{Z}(\mathbb{B})\longrightarrow\prod_{x\in\mathbb{B}}\mathbf{Mor}_{% \mathbb{B}}(x,x)$ to the product of the endomorphism categories which is forgetful on objects.
Definition 3.10. $\mathrm{Z}_{1}^{1,1}=\{f\in\mathrm{E}_{1}^{1,1}\,|\,f(M\otimes N)=(% \operatorname{id}(M)\otimes f(N))(f(M)\otimes\operatorname{id}(N))\}$
Definition 5.1. A fusion category is a semisimple abelian tensor category $(\mathbf{F},\otimes,I)$ over a field $\mathfrak{K}$ of characteristic zero, usually assumed to be algebraically closed, with finitely many simple objects, such that $\otimes$ is bilinear, and such that each object has a dual object.
Definition 3.4. The monoid $\mathrm{E}_{2}^{0,0}$ is defined as the equalizer of $\mathrm{d}_{1}^{\prime}$ and $\mathrm{d}_{1}^{\prime\prime}$.
Definition 5.1. We say that $(R,d,P)$ is a differential Rota-Baxter algebra of weight $\lambda$ if (a) $(R,d)$ is a differential algebra of weight $\lambda$, (b) $(R,P)$ is a Rota-Baxter algebra of weight $\lambda$, and (c) $d\circ P={\rm id}_{R}$.
Definition 2.1. Let $R$ be an algebra. (a) A Rota-Baxter operator of weight $\lambda$ on $R$, or simply a Rota-Baxter operator on $R$ is a ${\bf k}$-linear endomorphism $P$ of $R$ satisfying $P(x)P(y)=P(xP(y))+P(yP(x))+\lambda P(xy),\ \text{ for all }x,\ y\in R.$ (b) A Rota-Baxter algebra of weight $\lambda$, or simply a Rota-Baxter algebra, is a pair $(R,P)$ where $R$ is an algebra and $P$ is a Rota-Baxter operator on $R$. (c) Let $(R,P)$ and $(S,Q)$ be two Rota-Baxter algebras. A homomorphism of Rota-Baxter algebras $f:(R,P)\rightarrow(S,Q)$ is a homomorphism $f:R\rightarrow S$ of algebras with the property that $f(P(x))=Q(f(x))$ for all $x\in R$.
Definition 3.1. Let ${\bf k}$ be a ring, $\lambda\in{\bf k}$, and let $R$ be an algebra. (a) A derivation of weight $\lambda$ on $R$ over ${\bf k}$ or more briefly, a $\lambda$-derivation on $R$ over ${\bf k}$ is a module endomorphism $d$ of $R$ satisfying both $d(xy)=d(x)y+xd(y)+\lambda d(x)d(y),\ \text{ for all }x,\ y\in R$ and $d({\bf 1}_{R})=0.$ (b) A $\lambda$-differential algebra is a pair $(R,d)$ where $R$ is an algebra and $d$ is a $\lambda$-derivation on $R$ over ${\bf k}$. (c) Let $(R,d)$ and $(S,e)$ be two $\lambda$-differential algebras. A homomorphism of $\lambda$-differential algebras $f:(R,d)\rightarrow(S,e)$ is a homomorphism $f:R\rightarrow S$ of algebras such that $f(d(x))=e(f(x))$ for all $x\in R$.
Definition 4.1. Given a category $\mathbf{A}$, a monad ${\mathbf{T}}=\langle T,\eta,\mu\rangle$ on $\mathbf{A}$ and a comonad $\mathbf{C}=\langle C,\varepsilon,\delta\rangle$ on $\mathbf{A}$, then a mixed distributive law of $\mathbf{T}$ over $\mathbf{C}$ is a natural transformation $\beta:TC\rightarrow CT$ such that (a) $\beta\circ\eta C=C\eta$; (b) $\varepsilon T\circ\beta=T\varepsilon$; (c) $\delta T\circ\beta=C\beta\circ\beta C\circ T\delta$ and (d) $\beta\circ\mu C=C\mu\circ\beta T\circ T\beta$. That is, the diagrams $\xymatrix{&C\ar[dr]^{C\eta}\ar[dl]_{\eta C}&\\ TC\ar[rr]_{\beta}\ar[dr]_{T\varepsilon}&&CT\ar[dl]^{\varepsilon T}\\ &T&}$ $\begin{array}[]{c}\xymatrix{TC\ar[rr]^{\beta}\ar[d]_{T\delta}\hfil&&CT\ar[d]^{% \delta T}\\ TCC\ar[r]_{\beta C}&CTC\ar[r]_{C\beta}&CCT\end{array}\text{and}\begin{array}[]% {c}\xymatrix{TTC\ar[r]^{T\beta}\ar[d]_{\mu C}\hfil&TCT\ar[r]^{\beta T}&CTT\ar[% d]^{C\mu}\\ TC\ar[rr]_{\beta}&&CT\end{array}}}$ commute.
Definition 3.6 (rwn-rule). For n $\geq$ 2, a rwn-rule is a rule that removes a redundancy generated by rwn-1-equality. For n = 1, just use the definition of rw-rule.
Definition 3.2 (Arrow isomorphism [2]). Let f : A$\rightarrow$ B be an arrow of any category C. f is called an isomorphism if there exists a g: B$\rightarrow$ A $\in$ C1 such that g $\circ$ f = 1A and f $\circ$ g = 1B. g is called the inverse of f and can be written as f-1.
Definition 2.4 (rw-reduction). Let a and b be computational paths. We say that a $\rhd$rw b (read as: a rw-reduces to b) iff we can obtain b from a by a finite number of applications of rw-contractions.
Definition 2.1 (Computational path [6]). Let a and b be elements of a type A. A computational path from a to b is a sequence of rewrites and substitutions, i.e., a sequence of definitional equalities, that starts from a and arrives at b.
Definition 2.2 (rw-rule). A rw-rule is any of the rules defined in LNDEQ-TRS.
Definition 3.4 (Arw). Let Arw be the structure composed by objects and arrows with the following interpretation: • Objects: The objects of Arw are elements a of the type A, i.e. a : A. • Arrows: An arrow s : a$\rightarrow$ b between elements a,b of the type A is a sequence of rewrite between these elements. In other words, there exists an arrow s between elements a and b iff there exists a computational path s such that a =s b.
Definition 2.5 (rw-equality). Let a and b be computational paths. We say that a =rw b (read as: a is rw-equal to b) iff b can be obtained from a by a finite (perhaps empty) series of rw-contractions and reversed rw-contractions. In other words, a =rw b iff there exists a sequence R0,….,Rn, with $n\geq 0$, such that ($\forall$i $\leq$ n - 1) (Ri$\rhd$1rw Ri+1 or Ri+1 $\rhd$1rw Ri) R0 $\equiv$ a, Rn $\equiv$ b
Definition 3.3 (Categorical Groupoid [4]). A groupoid is a category such that every arrow is an isomorphism.
Definition 3.7 (Anrw). for n $\geq$ 2, Anrw is the following structure: • Objects: The objects are the morphisms between a pair of objects of A(n-1)rw. • Arrows: There exists an arrow $\theta$ : s $\rightarrow$ t iff s =rwn-1 t, where s and t are objects of Anrw For n = 1, just take the usual definition of Arw.
Definition 3.1 (Category [2]). A category is the structure with the following elements and rules: • Objects: Generally represented by capital letters (e. g. A, B). The set of all objects is called C0. • Arrows: Generally represented by function letters (e. g. f, g). Arrows are morphisms between the objects. The set of all arrows is called C1. • Domain and codomain: Given an arrow f : A$\rightarrow$ B, the domain of f is dom(f) = A and the codomain is cod(f) = B. • Compositions: Given arrows f : A$\rightarrow$ B and g : B$\rightarrow$ C, there always exists an arrow g $\circ$ f : A $\rightarrow$ C. Such arrow is called the composite of f and g. • Identity arrow: For each object A there exists an arrow 1A: A $\rightarrow$ A called the identity arrow. • Rule of Associativity: Given arrows f : A$\rightarrow$ B, g : B$\rightarrow$ C and h : C$\rightarrow$ D, we always have that h $\circ$ (g $\circ$ f) = (h $\circ$ g) $\circ$ f. • Unit Rule: For all arrow f : A$\rightarrow$ B, f $\circ$ 1A = f = 1B $\circ$ f.
Definition 3.5 (A2rw). A2rw(x,y) is the following structure: • Objects: The objects are the morphisms of Arw between objects x and y, i.e., the sequence of rewrites starting at x and ending at y. • Arrows: A rewrite of a sequence of rewrites, as we already know, is just the application of rw-rules. That way, there exists an arrow $\theta$ : s $\rightarrow$ t iff s =rw t, where s and t are paths of Arw. It is important to note that every pair of objects x and y of Arw generates a structure A2rw(x,y).
Definition 2.3 (rw-contraction). Let a and b be computational paths. We say that a $\rhd$1rw b (read as: a rw-contracts to b) iff we can obtain b from a by an application of only one rw-rule.
Definition 2.8. Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a $k$-linear rigid braided monoidal category. We define the Witt group of $\mathcal{C}$, which we denote by $W(\mathcal{C})$, as follows: $W(\mathcal{C})={K_{0}(\mathcal{Q})}/{\rm Im}(K_{0}(\mathcal{H})).$
Definition 2.4. Let $M$ be an object of $\mathcal{C}$. We say that $M$ is weakly symmetric if ${\rm ev}_{M}={\rm ev}_{M}\circ c_{M,M^{*}}\circ c_{M^{*},M}$.
Definition 5.1 ([5], Definition 1.1). $G$ and $H$ are called isocategorical if ${\sf Rep\hbox{-}}{G}$ is monoidal equivalent to ${\sf Rep\hbox{-}}{H}$ (without regard for the symmetric structure).
Definition 2.2. Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a monoidal category satisfying the above assumptions and let $M$ be an object in $\mathcal{C}$. A bilinear form $b:M\otimes M\rightarrow I$ is called symmetric if $b\circ c_{M,M}=b$. It is called non-singular if $h_{M}(b):M\rightarrow M^{*}$ is an isomorphism.
Definition 3.1. [7, Definition 2.1] Let $\mathcal{A}$ be an exact category. A cotorsion pair in $\mathcal{A}$ is a pair $(\mathcal{X},\mathcal{Y})$ of classes of objects of $\mathcal{A}$ such that $(i)$ $\mathcal{X}={{}^{\perp_{1}}\mathcal{Y}}:=\{X\in\mathcal{A}\ |\ {\rm Ext}^{1}_{% \mathcal{A}}(X,Y)=0,\forall\ Y\in\mathcal{Y}\}.$ $(ii)$ $\mathcal{Y}={\mathcal{X}^{\perp_{1}}}:=\{Y\in\mathcal{A}\ |\ {\rm Ext}^{1}_{% \mathcal{A}}(X,Y)=0,\forall\ X\in\mathcal{X}\}.$
Definition 3.5. [22, Definition 2.3] Let $\mathcal{A}$ be an exact category and let $I$ be a set of inflations. $I$ is said to be homological if for any object $A\in\mathcal{A}$, the morphism $A\to 0$ belongs to $I\mbox{-inj}$ implies $A\in({\rm Cok}I)^{\perp_{1}}$.
Definition 2.5. Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a category. A set $I$ of morphisms in $\mathcal{C}$ is said to admit the small object argument if the following conditions hold: $(i)$ The transfinite compositions of pushouts of morphisms in $I$ exist. $(ii)$ The coproducts of morphisms in $I$ exist. $(iii)$ The domains of the morphisms of $I$ are small relative to $I$-cell.
Definition 2.2. $($[12, Definition 2.1.9]$)$ Let $I$ be a set of morphisms in a category $\mathcal{C}$. Assume that the transfinite compositions of pushouts of morphisms in $I$ exist. A relative $I\mbox{-}cell$ complex is a transfinite composition of pushouts of morphisms in $I$. That is, if $f:A\to B$ is a relative $I$-cell complex, then there is an ordinal $\lambda$ and a $\lambda$-sequence $X:\lambda\to\mathcal{C}$ such that $f$ is the transfinite composition of $X$ and such that, for each $\alpha$ such that $\alpha+1<\lambda$, there is a pushout as follows, $\xymatrix{C_{\alpha}\ar[r]\ar[d]_{g_{\alpha}}&X_{\alpha}\ar[d]\\ D_{\alpha}\ar[r]&X_{\alpha+1}}$ such that $g_{\alpha}\in I$.
Definition 2.1. ([12, Definition 2.1.7]) Let $I$ be a set of morphisms in a category $\mathcal{C}$. $(1)$ A morphism is $I$-injective if it has the RLP with respect to every morphism in $I$. The class of $I$-injective morphisms is denoted $I$-inj. $(2)$ A morphism is an $I$-cofibration if it has the LLP with respect to every $I$-injective morphism. The class of $I$-cofibrations is denoted $I$-cof.
Definition 1.3. Let $\mathscr{C}_{1},\mathscr{C}_{2}$ are two small categories. We say that they are homotopy equivalent if there are functors $f\colon\mathscr{C}_{1}\to\mathscr{C}_{2}$ and $g\colon\mathscr{C}_{2}\to\mathscr{C}_{1}$ such that the two compositions $B(g)\circ B(f)$ and $B(f)\circ B(g)$ are homotopy to the identity maps of $B\mathscr{C}_{1}$ and of $B\mathscr{C}_{2}$, correspondingly.
Definition 2.1. Let $f,g\colon\mathscr{C}_{1}\to\mathscr{C}_{2}$ be functors. They are called homotopic in the sense of Evrard if there is a functor $H\colon\mathscr{C}_{1}\to\Lambda_{n}\mathscr{C}_{2}$, for some $n\geq 1$, such that $p_{0}\circ H=f$ and $p_{1}\circ H=g$. A functor $f\colon\mathscr{C}_{1}\to\mathscr{C}_{2}$ is called a homotopy equivalence in the sense of Evrard if there exists a functor $f^{\prime}\colon\mathscr{C}_{2}\to\mathscr{C}_{1}$ such that both compositions $f\circ f^{\prime}$ and $f^{\prime}\circ f$ are homotopy equivalent to the identity functors in the sense of Evrard.
Definition 1.1. Two functors $f,g\colon\mathscr{C}_{1}\to\mathscr{C}_{2}$ are said to be homotopic (in the sense of Quillen) if the corresponding maps $Bf,Bg\colon B\mathscr{C}_{1}\to B\mathscr{C}_{2}$ are homotopic maps of topological spaces. A functor $f\colon\mathscr{C}_{1}\to\mathscr{C}_{2}$ is a homotopy equivalence if there is a functor $f^{\prime}\colon\mathscr{C}_{2}\to\mathscr{C}_{1}$ such that the compositions $f\circ f^{\prime}$ and $f^{\prime}\circ f$ are homotopy equivalent to the identity maps.
Definition 9.1. A rigid C${}^{*}$-tensor category $\mathcal{C}$ is said to have the almost completely positive approximation property (ACPAP) if there exists a net of cp-multipliers $\varphi_{n}:\operatorname{Irr}(\mathcal{C})\rightarrow\mathbb{C}$ that converges to $1$ pointwise and such that for every fixed $n$, there exists a net of finitely supported cb-multipliers $\psi^{n}_{k}:\operatorname{Irr}(\mathcal{C})\rightarrow\mathbb{C}$ such that $\lim_{k}\|\varphi_{n}-\psi^{n}_{k}\|_{\text{\rm cb}}=0$.
Definition 2.2. Let $N\subset M$ be an extremal subfactor with associated SE-inclusion $T\subset S$. We call SE-multiplier of $N\subset M$ every normal $T$-bimodular linear map $\psi:S\rightarrow S$. When moreover $\psi$ is completely positive, resp. completely bounded, we call $\psi$ a cp SE-multiplier, resp. cb SE-multiplier of $N\subset M$.
Definition 3.1. A multiplier of an extended $\lambda$-lattice $\widetilde{\mathcal{G}}=(A_{nm})_{n\leq m}$ is a family of linear maps $\theta_{n,m}:A_{nm}\rightarrow A_{nm}\quad\text{for all}\quad n\leq 0\leq m\;,$ that are $A_{n0}\vee A_{0m}$-bimodular and that are compatible with the inclusions $A_{nm}\subset A_{ab}$ if $a\leq n$ and $b\geq m$. The multiplier $\theta$ is said to be of positive type if all $\theta_{n,m}$ are completely positive maps. We then say that $\theta$ is a cp-multiplier of $\widetilde{\mathcal{G}}$. The multiplier $\theta$ is said to be completely bounded if $\|\theta\|_{\text{\rm cb}}:=\sup_{n,m}\|\theta_{n,m}\|_{\text{\rm cb}}<\infty$. We then say that $\theta$ is a cb-multiplier of $\widetilde{\mathcal{G}}$.
Definition 5.1. A rigid C${}^{*}$-tensor category $\mathcal{C}$ is said 1. to be amenable if there exists a net of finitely supported cp-multipliers $\varphi_{n}:\operatorname{Irr}(\mathcal{C})\rightarrow\mathbb{C}$ that converges to $1$ pointwise ; 2. to have property (T) if every net of cp-multipliers $\varphi_{n}:\operatorname{Irr}(\mathcal{C})\rightarrow\mathbb{C}$ that converges to $1$ pointwise, must converge to $1$ uniformly on $\operatorname{Irr}(\mathcal{C})$ ; 3. to have the Haagerup property if there exists a net of cp-multipliers $\varphi_{n}:\operatorname{Irr}(\mathcal{C})\rightarrow\mathbb{C}$ such that every $\varphi_{n}$ converges to $0$ at infinity and such that $\varphi_{n}\rightarrow 1$ pointwise ; 4. to be weakly amenable if there exists a net of finitely supported cb-multipliers $\varphi_{n}:\operatorname{Irr}(\mathcal{C})\rightarrow\mathbb{C}$ that converges to $1$ pointwise and such that $\limsup_{n}\|\varphi_{n}\|_{\text{\rm cb}}<\infty$. The smallest possible value of $\limsup_{n}\|\varphi_{n}\|_{\text{\rm cb}}$ is called the Cowling-Haagerup constant $\Lambda(\mathcal{C})$ of $\mathcal{C}$. If $\Lambda(\mathcal{C})=1$, we say that $\mathcal{C}$ has CMAP. Obviously, if $\operatorname{Irr}(\mathcal{C})$ is countable, nets may everywhere be replaced by sequences.
Definition 2.1. Let $N\subset M$ be an extremal subfactor with associated SE-inclusion $T\subset S$. An SE-correspondence of $N\subset M$ is a Hilbert $S$-bimodule $\mathord{\raisebox{-1.72pt}[0.0pt][0.0pt]{\scriptsize$S$}{\mathcal{H}}\hskip-1% .075pt\raisebox{-1.72pt}[0.0pt][0.0pt]{\scriptsize$S$}}$ that is generated by $T$-central vectors.
Definition 4.1. Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a rigid C${}^{*}$-tensor category. A $*$-representation $\Theta:\mathbb{C}[\mathcal{C}]\rightarrow B(\mathcal{K})$ of the fusion $*$-algebra $\mathbb{C}[\mathcal{C}]$ is called admissible if for all $\xi\in\mathcal{K}$, the map $\operatorname{Irr}(\mathcal{C})\rightarrow\mathbb{C}:\alpha\mapsto d(\alpha)^{% -1}\langle\Theta(\alpha)\xi,\xi\rangle$ is a cp-multiplier on $\mathcal{C}$. By Proposition 4.2 below, for every admissible $*$-representation, we have $\|\Theta(\alpha)\|\leq d(\alpha)$ for all $\alpha\in\mathcal{C}$. We can thus define the universal C${}^{*}$-algebra $C_{u}(\mathcal{C})$ as the completion of $\mathbb{C}[\mathcal{C}]$ in a universal admissible $*$-representation.
Definition 2.4. Let $N\subset M$ be an extremal subfactor with associated SE-inclusion $T\subset S$ and category of $M$-bimodules $\mathcal{C}$. We call a $*$-representation of $\mathbb{C}[\mathcal{C}]$ on a Hilbert space admissible if it is unitarily conjugate to the $*$-representation associated with an SE-correspondence $\mathord{\raisebox{-1.72pt}[0.0pt][0.0pt]{\scriptsize$S$}{\mathcal{H}}\hskip-1% .075pt\raisebox{-1.72pt}[0.0pt][0.0pt]{\scriptsize$S$}}$ of $N\subset M$ as in Theorem 2.3. We define the universal C${}^{*}$-algebra $C_{u}(N\subset M)$ as the completion of $\mathbb{C}[\mathcal{C}]$ with respect to a universal admissible representation of $\mathbb{C}[\mathcal{C}]$.
Definition 3.4. A multiplier on a rigid C${}^{*}$-tensor category $\mathcal{C}$ is a family of linear maps $\theta_{\alpha,\beta}:\operatorname{End}(\alpha\otimes\beta)\rightarrow% \operatorname{End}(\alpha\otimes\beta)\quad\text{for all}\;\;\alpha,\beta\in% \mathcal{C}$ that satisfy the following compatibility conditions. $\begin{split}\displaystyle\theta_{\alpha_{2},\beta_{2}}(UXV^{*})&\displaystyle% =U\,\theta_{\alpha_{1},\beta_{1}}(X)\,V^{*}\;\;,\\ \displaystyle\theta_{\alpha_{2}\otimes\alpha_{1},\beta_{1}\otimes\beta_{2}}(1% \otimes X\otimes 1)&\displaystyle=1\otimes\theta_{\alpha_{1},\beta_{1}}(X)% \otimes 1\;\;,\end{split}$ for all $\alpha_{i},\beta_{i}\in\mathcal{C}$ and all $X\in\operatorname{End}(\alpha_{1}\otimes\beta_{1})$ and $U,V\in\operatorname{Mor}(\alpha_{2},\alpha_{1})\otimes\operatorname{Mor}(\beta% _{2},\beta_{1})$. In particular, all $\theta_{\alpha,\beta}$ are $(\operatorname{End}(\alpha)\otimes\operatorname{End}(\beta))$-bimodular The multiplier $\theta$ is said to be of positive type if all $\theta_{\alpha,\beta}$ are completely positive maps. We then call $\theta$ a cp-multiplier. The multiplier $\theta$ is said to be completely bounded if $\|\theta\|_{\text{\rm cb}}:=\sup_{\alpha,\beta\in\mathcal{C}}\|\theta_{\alpha,% \beta}\|_{\text{\rm cb}}<\infty$. We then call $\theta$ a cb-multiplier.
Definition 1. Let $(X,\Sigma_{X})$ be a measurable space. A positive operator-valued measure (POVM) on $X$ is a morphism $\Sigma_{X}\to\mathcal{E}\!f(H)$ of $\sigma$-effect algebras. A POVM is a projection-valued measure (PVM) if its image is contained in $\mathcal{P}\!roj(H)$.
Definition 3.7. We let $\mathscr{C}^{q}\colon{\sf D}^{q}\to{\sf R}^{q}$ and $\mathscr{V}^{q}\colon{\sf R}^{q}\to{\sf D}^{q}$ be the functors given by Lemma 3.6 as the canonical factorisations of the functors $\mathscr{V}_{\rho}\circ\mathscr{C}$ and $\mathscr{C}_{\delta}\circ\mathscr{V}$ through the projection functors $\mathscr{C}_{\delta}$ and $\mathscr{V}_{\rho}$, respectively.
Definition 6.1. For $\nu$ a cardinal, a ${\sf V}$-operation (or, more simply, an operation) of arity $\nu$ is a ${\sf V}$-homomorphism $t\colon{\mathscr{F}}{(1)}\to{\mathscr{F}}{(\nu)}$. The operation $h$ is finitary if $\nu$ is finite, and infinitary otherwise. An operation on the ${\sf V}$-algebra $A$ is a function $f\colon A^{\nu}\to A$ that is definable in the sense of Definition 5.1, that is, such that $h=\mathscr{I}{(t)}:={\rm ev}{(t,-)}$ for some $t\colon{\mathscr{F}}{(1)}\to{\mathscr{F}}{(\nu)}$.
Definition 7.4 (Gelfand and Birkhoff transforms). Given a cardinal $\nu$ and a congruence $\theta$ on ${\mathscr{F}}{(\nu)}$, the homomorphisms $\gamma_{\theta}:=\iota_{\theta}\circ\sigma_{\theta}$ and $\sigma_{\theta}$ given by the commutative diagram above are called the Gelfand and the Birkhoff transforms (of ${\mathscr{F}}{(\nu)}/\theta$ with respect to $A$), respectively.
Definition 4.10. Let $\mathbb{T}$ be a theory over a signature $\mathcal{L}$ in a given fragment of first-order logic. The syntactic category $\mathcal{C}_{\mathbb{T}}$ of $\mathbb{T}$ has as objects the formulas-in-context $\{\vec{x}.\phi\}$ over the signature (considered up to ‘renaming’ of variables), where the context $\vec{x}$ contains all the free variables appearing in the formula $\phi$. The arrows $\{\vec{x}.\phi\}\to\{\vec{y}.\phi\}$3We always suppose, without loss of generality, that the contexts $\vec{x}$ and $\vec{y}$ are disjoint. are the $\mathbb{T}$-provable equivalence classes $[\theta]$ of formulas $\theta(\vec{x},\vec{y})$ which are $\mathbb{T}$-provably functional from $\phi(\vec{x})$ to $\psi(\vec{y})$, in the sense that the sequents $(\phi\vdash_{\vec{x}}(\exists y)\theta(\vec{x},\vec{y})),$ $(\theta\vdash_{\vec{x},\vec{y}}\phi\wedge\psi)$ and $(\theta(\vec{x},\vec{y})\wedge\theta(\vec{x},\vec{z}/\vec{y})\vdash_{\vec{x},% \vec{y},\vec{z}}\vec{y}=\vec{z})$ are provable in $\mathbb{T}$4Recall that a sequent $(\phi\vdash_{\vec{x}}\psi)$ has the same meaning that the first-order sentence $(\forall\vec{x})(\phi\!\Rightarrow\!\psi)$. .
Definition 8.1. We say that a function $f\colon A^{\mu}\to A$ is strongly continuous if the pre-images of a sets of the form $\operatorname{\operatorname{\mathbb{V}}\circ\operatorname{\mathbb{C}}}{(S)}$ with $S\subseteq A$ can be written as $\operatorname{\operatorname{\mathbb{V}}\circ\operatorname{\mathbb{C}}}{(T)}$ with $T\subseteq A^{\mu}$.
