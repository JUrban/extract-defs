Definition 2. A terminal object, $\mathbbm{1}$, in a category $C$ is an object such that for any other $c\in Ob(C)$ there exists a unique morphism $f\in Hom_{C}(c,\mathbbm{1})$.
Definition 7. A partially ordered semiring homomorphism between $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$ is a function $f:R_{1}\rightarrow R_{2}$ such that $f(a+b)=f(a)+f(b)$, $f(ab)=f(a)f(b)$, and $f(1_{R_{1}})=1_{R_{2}}$. Additionally, we require $a\leq b\Rightarrow f(a)\leq f(b)$.
Definition 3. A presheaf of sets over an ASC $X$ is a covariant functor, $F:\text{FACE}(X)\rightarrow\text{SET}$, from the face category, $\text{FACE}(X)$, to the category SET.
Definition 8. An ordered semiring is a semiring, $R$, with a total order relation $\leq$ on $R$ satisfying: (a) if $a\leq b$ then $a+c\leq b+c$, and (b) if $a\leq b$ and $0\leq c$ then $ac\leq bc$ and $ca\leq cb$.
Definition 5. Given two functors, $F_{1},F_{2}:C\rightarrow D$, from category $C$ to category $D$, a natural transformation, $\eta:F_{1}\implies F_{2}$, has two requirements. 1. To each object $x\in C$ we associate a morphism $\eta_{x}:F_{1}(x)\rightarrow F_{2}(x)$ in $D$ 2. For each $f\in Hom_{C}(x,y)$ we must have $\eta_{y}\circ F_{1}(f)=F_{2}(f)\circ\eta_{x}$. In other words, the following diagram must commute
Definition 1. A category, $\mathcal{C}$, consists of a class of objects, $Ob(\mathcal{C})$, and a class of morphisms, $Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(C,D)$, for each pair of objects, $C,D\in Ob(\mathcal{C})$. Additionally, for each three objects $A,B,C\in Ob(\mathcal{C})$ there is a composition of morphisms $\circ:Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(A,B)\times Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(B,C)\rightarrow Hom_{% \mathcal{C}}(A,C)$, i.e., for each $f:A\rightarrow B$ and $g:B\rightarrow C$ there is a unique $g\circ f:A\rightarrow C$, such that the following holds: • Composition of morphisms is associative. If $f:A\rightarrow B$, $g:B\rightarrow C$, and $h:C\rightarrow D$ then $h\circ(g\circ f)=(h\circ g)\circ f$. • There is an identity morphism for each object C, $1_{C}:C\rightarrow C$, such that $1_{C}\circ g=g$ and $h\circ 1_{C}=h$.
Definition 5.2. Under Assumption 2.4 we say that $R_{K}$ preserves $T$-algebras if: (1) When $X$ is a $T$-algebra there is some $T$-algebra $\widetilde{X}$ that is weakly equivalent in $\mathcal{M}$ to $R_{K}UX$. (2) In addition, when $X$ is a fibrant $T$-algebra, there is a choice of $\widetilde{X}$ in $\mathsf{Alg}(T;\mathcal{M})$, with $U(\widetilde{X})$ colocal in $\mathcal{M}$, there is a $T$-algebra homomorphism $c_{X}:\widetilde{X}\hskip-2.845276pt\SelectTips{cm}{10}\xymatrix@C-.2cm{\ar[r]% &}\hskip-2.845276ptX$ lifting the colocalization map $q:R_{K}UX\hskip-2.845276pt\SelectTips{cm}{10}\xymatrix@C-.2cm{\ar[r]&}\hskip-2% .845276ptUX$ up to homotopy, and there is a weak equivalence $\beta_{X}:U(\widetilde{X})\hskip-2.845276pt\SelectTips{cm}{10}\xymatrix@C-.2cm% {\ar[r]&}\hskip-2.845276ptR_{K}UX$ such that $q\circ\beta_{X}\cong Uc_{X}$ in Ho$(\mathcal{M})$.
Definition 3.2. Suppose $\mathcal{M}$ is a model category, $C$ is a saturated class of maps in $\mathcal{M}$, and $T$ is a monad on $\mathcal{M}$. (1) We say that $\mathcal{M}$ is $C$-perfect [BB14] (Def. 2.1) if weak equivalences in $\mathcal{M}$ are closed under filtered colimits along maps in $C$. (2) We say that $\mathcal{M}$ is $C$-compactly generated [BB14] (Def. 2.4) if it is cofibrantly generated and $C$-perfect and if every object is small with respect to $C$ [Hov99] (Def. 2.1.3). (3) We say that $T$ is $C$-admissible on $\mathcal{M}$ [BB14] (Def. 2.9) if for each cofibration (resp., trivial cofibration) $f:A\hskip-2.845276pt\SelectTips{cm}{10}\xymatrix@C-.2cm{\ar[r]&}\hskip-2.84527% 6ptB\in\mathcal{M}$ and each pushout of the form $\SelectTips{cm}{10}\xymatrix@C+5pt{T(A)\ar[d]_{-}{Tf}\ar[r]&X\ar[d]^{-}{g}\\ T(B)\ar[r]&Y}$ in $\mathsf{Alg}(T;\mathcal{M})$, the underlying map $Ug\in\mathcal{M}$ is in $C$ (resp., $C$ and the class of weak equivalences), where $U:\mathsf{Alg}(T;\mathcal{M})\hskip-2.845276pt\SelectTips{cm}{10}\xymatrix@C-.% 2cm{\ar[r]&}\hskip-2.845276pt\mathcal{M}$ is the forgetful functor. (4) We say that $T$ is $C$-semi-admissible on $\mathcal{M}$ [BW16] (Def. 2.4) if the previous statement holds whenever $UX$ is cofibrant in $\mathcal{M}$.
Definition 2.3. Suppose $\mathcal{M}$ is a model category, and $K\subseteq\mathcal{M}$ is a set of cofibrant objects. (1) A $K$-colocal equivalence is a map $f:A\hskip-2.845276pt\SelectTips{cm}{10}\xymatrix@C-.2cm{\ar[r]&}\hskip-2.84527% 6ptB\in\mathcal{M}$ such that the induced map $\SelectTips{cm}{10}\xymatrix@C+5pt@C+1cm{\operatorname{map}_{\mathcal{M}}(X,A)% \ar[r]^{-}{\operatorname{map}_{\mathcal{M}}(X,f)}&\operatorname{map}_{\mathcal% {M}}(X,B)}$ is a weak equivalence of simplicial sets for all $X\in K$. (2) A $K$-colocal object is a cofibrant object $Y$ in $\mathcal{M}$ such that the induced map $\SelectTips{cm}{10}\xymatrix@C+5pt@C+1cm{\operatorname{map}_{\mathcal{M}}(Y,A)% \ar[r]^{-}{\operatorname{map}_{\mathcal{M}}(Y,f)}&\operatorname{map}_{\mathcal% {M}}(Y,B)}$ is a weak equivalence of simplicial sets for all $K$-colocal equivalences $f:A\hskip-2.845276pt\SelectTips{cm}{10}\xymatrix@C-.2cm{\ar[r]&}\hskip-2.84527% 6ptB$. (3) Define a new category $R_{K}\mathcal{M}$ as being the same as $\mathcal{M}$ as a category, together with the following distinguished classes of maps. A map $f$ in $R_{K}\mathcal{M}$ is called a: • weak equivalence if it is a $K$-colocal equivalence. • fibration if it is a fibration in $\mathcal{M}$. (4) If $R_{K}\mathcal{M}$ is a model category with these weak equivalences and fibrations, then it is called the right Bousfield localization of $\mathcal{M}$ with respect to $K$ [Hir03] (Def. 3.3.1(2) and Theorem 5.1.1). In this case, $K$-colocal objects are precisely the cofibrant objects in $R_{K}\mathcal{M}$.
Definition 2.2. Suppose $\mathcal{M}$ is a model category, $T$ is a monad on $\mathcal{M}$, and $\mathsf{Alg}(T;\mathcal{M})$ is the category of $T$-algebras in $\mathcal{M}$. We say that $\mathsf{Alg}(T;\mathcal{M})$ is (semi-)admissible over $\mathcal{M}$ if it admits a (semi-)model category structure in which a map $f$ is a weak equivalence (resp., fibration) if $Uf\in\mathcal{M}$ is a weak equivalence (resp., fibration), where $U:\mathsf{Alg}(T;\mathcal{M})\hskip-2.845276pt\SelectTips{cm}{10}\xymatrix@C-.% 2cm{\ar[r]&}\hskip-2.845276pt\mathcal{M}$ is the forgetful functor.
Definition 2.1. Assume there is an adjunction $F:\mathcal{M}\SelectTips{cm}{10}\xymatrix{\ar@<2pt>[r]&\ar@<2pt>[l]}\mathcal{D% }:U$ where $\mathcal{M}$ is a cofibrantly generated model category, $\mathcal{D}$ is bicomplete, and the right adjoint $U$ preserves colimits over non-empty ordinals. We say that $\mathcal{D}$ is a semi-model category if $\mathcal{D}$ has three classes of morphisms called weak equivalences, fibrations, and cofibrations such that the following axioms are satisfied. A cofibrant object $X$ means an object in $\mathcal{D}$ such that the map from the initial object of $\mathcal{D}$ to $X$ is a cofibration in $\mathcal{D}$. Likewise, a fibrant object is an object for which the map to the terminal object in $\mathcal{D}$ is a fibration in $\mathcal{D}$. (1) $U$ preserves and reflects fibrations and trivial fibrations ($=$ maps that are both weak equivalences and fibrations). (2) $\mathcal{D}$ satisfies the 2-out-of-3 axiom and the retract axiom. (3) Cofibrations in $\mathcal{D}$ have the left lifting property with respect to trivial fibrations. Trivial cofibrations ($=$ maps that are both weak equivalences and cofibrations) in $\mathcal{D}$ whose domain is cofibrant in $\mathcal{M}$ have the left lifting property with respect to fibrations. (4) Every map in $\mathcal{D}$ can be functorially factored into a cofibration followed by a trivial fibration. Every map in $\mathcal{D}$ whose domain is cofibrant in $\mathcal{M}$ can be functorially factored into a trivial cofibration followed by a fibration. (5) The initial object in $\mathcal{D}$ is cofibrant in $\mathcal{M}$. (6) Fibrations and trivial fibrations are closed under pullback. Denote by $I^{\prime}$-inj the class of maps that have the right lifting property with respect to maps in $I^{\prime}$. $\mathcal{D}$ is said to be cofibrantly generated if there are sets of morphisms $I^{\prime}$ and $J^{\prime}$ in $\mathcal{D}$ such that the following conditions are satisfied. (1) $I^{\prime}$-inj is the class of trivial fibrations. (2) $J^{\prime}$-inj is the class of fibrations in $\mathcal{D}$. (3) The domains of $I^{\prime}$ are small relative to $I^{\prime}$-cell. (4) The domains of $J^{\prime}$ are small relative to maps in $J^{\prime}$-cell whose domain is sent by $U$ to a cofibrant object in $\mathcal{M}$.
Definition 5.1. Under Assumption 2.4 we say that $R_{K}$ lifts to the homotopy category of $T$-algebras if: (1) There exists a coaugmented endofunctor $c^{T}:C^{T}\hskip-2.845276pt\SelectTips{cm}{10}\xymatrix@C-.2cm{\ar[r]&}\hskip% -2.845276pt\operatorname{Id}$ on $\mathsf{Ho}(\mathsf{Alg}(T;\mathcal{M}))$. (2) There exists a natural isomorphism $h:R_{K}U\hskip-2.845276pt\SelectTips{cm}{10}\xymatrix@C-.2cm{\ar[r]&}\hskip-2.% 845276ptUC^{T}$ such that $Uc^{T}\circ h=cU$ in $\mathsf{Ho}(\mathcal{M})$, where $c:R_{K}\hskip-2.845276pt\SelectTips{cm}{10}\xymatrix@C-.2cm{\ar[r]&}\hskip-2.8% 45276pt\operatorname{Id}$ is the counit of the derived adjunction $\mathsf{Ho}(R_{K}\mathcal{M})\SelectTips{cm}{10}\xymatrix{\ar@<2pt>[r]&\ar@<2% pt>[l]}\mathsf{Ho}(\mathcal{M})$ and $U$ is the forgetful functor.
Definition 3.1. Suppose $\mathcal{M}$ is a category, $C$ is a class of maps in $\mathcal{M}$, and $T$ is a monad on $\mathcal{M}$. (1) We call the class $C$ saturated if it is closed under retracts, pushouts, and transfinite compositions. (2) We call $T$ finitary if it preserves filtered colimits.
Definition 5.3. Under Assumption 2.4 suppose $R_{T(K)}\mathsf{Alg}(T;\mathcal{M})$ exists as a semi-model category. Then we say that the forgetful functor $\SelectTips{cm}{10}\xymatrix@C+5pt{R_{T(K)}\mathsf{Alg}(T;\mathcal{M})\ar[r]^{% -}{U}&R_{K}\mathcal{M}}$ preserves right Bousfield localization if, given any map $c:R_{T(K)}X\hskip-2.845276pt\SelectTips{cm}{10}\xymatrix@C-.2cm{\ar[r]&}\hskip% -2.845276ptX\in\mathsf{Alg}(T;\mathcal{M})$ that is a $T(K)$-colocal equivalence with $T(K)$-colocal domain, the map $Uc\in\mathcal{M}$ is a $K$-colocal equivalence with $K$-colocal domain.
Definition 4.1. Suppose $\mathcal{M}$ is a model category with a distinguished set of maps $J$, and $K$ is a set of objects in $\mathcal{M}$. (1) Define the set of maps $\Lambda(K)=\Bigl{\{}A^{\bullet}\otimes\partial\Delta[n]\hskip-2.845276pt% \SelectTips{cm}{10}\xymatrix@C-.2cm{\ar[r]&}\hskip-2.845276ptA^{\bullet}% \otimes\Delta[n]:A\in K,\,n\geq 0\Bigr{\}}$ in which $A^{\bullet}$ is a choice of a cosimplicial resolution of $A$ [Hir03] (Def. 16.1.2(1) and 16.3.1(1)). (2) Define the set $\overline{\Lambda(K)}=\Lambda(K)\cup J$ [Hir03] (Def. 5.2.1).
Definition 3.1. A rack is a quandle if its canonical automorphism is the identity.
Definition 1.6. If $(R,\rhd$) is a rack, its automorphism $\mathrm{F}$ from Proposition 1.5 will be referred to as its canonical automorphism. We will sometimes write $\mathrm{F}_{R}$ or $\mathrm{F}_{\rhd}$ for clarity.
Definition 6.2. A rack is involutary if $x\rhd(x\rhd y)=y$ for all $x$ and $y$. A kei is an involutary quandle.
Definition 1.1. A rack $(R,\rhd)$ is a set $R$ together with a binary operation $\rhd$ such that all left multiplications $\ell_{x}\colon R\longrightarrow R,\,y\longmapsto x\rhd y=\ell_{x}(y)$ are automorphisms, i.e. they are bijective and satisfy $\ell_{x}(y\rhd z)=\ell_{x}(y)\rhd\ell_{x}(z)$, or $x\rhd(y\rhd z)=(x\rhd y)\rhd(x\rhd z).$
Definition 4.1. Let $(\mathcal{M},m,r)$ be a right $\mathcal{P}$-module category and $(\mathcal{N},n,l)$ a left $\mathcal{P}$ category and $\mathcal{C}$ an arbitrary ($k$-linear) category. By a $\mathcal{P}$-balanced functor $(F,b):\mathcal{M}\otimes\mathcal{N}\to\mathcal{C}$, we mean a functor $F:\mathcal{M}\otimes\mathcal{N}\to\mathcal{C}$ together with natural isomorphisms $b_{M,P,N}:F((M\otimes P),N)\to F(M,(P\otimes N))$ for every $M\in\mathcal{M},P\in\mathcal{P},N\in\mathcal{N}$, such that the diagrams: $\xymatrix{F(M\otimes(P\otimes Q),N)\ar[rr]^{b_{M,(P\otimes Q),N}}\ar[d]_{m_{M,% P,Q}}&&F(M,(P\otimes Q)\otimes N)\ar[d]^{n_{P,Q,N}}\\ F((M\otimes P)\otimes Q,N)\ar[dr]_{b_{M\otimes P,Q,N}}&&F(M,P\otimes(Q\otimes N% ))\\ &F(M\otimes P,Q\otimes N)\ar[ur]_{b_{M,P,Q\otimes N}}&}$ and $\xymatrix{F(M\otimes{\bf 1},N)\ar[rd]_{r_{M}}\ar[rr]^{b_{M,{\bf 1},N}}&&F(M,{% \bf 1}\otimes N)\ar[dl]^{l_{N}}\\ &F(M,N)&}$ commute.
Definition 2.7. An abelian module category $\mathcal{M}$ over $\mathcal{P}$ is called locally finite over $\mathcal{P}$ if (i) The internal hom’s of every two object in $\mathcal{M}$ are objects in $\mathcal{P}$, and (ii) All objects have finite length.
Definition 2.3. A module category over a monoidal category $\mathcal{C}$ is a category $\mathcal{M}$ together with a functor $\otimes:\mathcal{C}\otimes\mathcal{M}\to\mathcal{M}$ and functorial associativity and unit isomorphisms $m_{X,Y,M}:(X\otimes Y)\otimes M\to X\otimes(Y\otimes M),\;l_{M}:{\bf 1}\otimes M\to M$ for any $X,Y\in\mathcal{C},\;M\in\mathcal{M}$ such that the diagrams $\xymatrix{&((X\otimes Y)\otimes Z)\otimes M\ar[dl]_{a_{X,Y,Z}\otimes id}\ar[dr% ]^{m_{X\otimes Y,Z,M}}&\\ (X\otimes(Y\otimes Z))\otimes M\ar[d]^{m_{X,Y\otimes Z,M}}&&(X\otimes Y)% \otimes(Z\otimes M)\ar[d]_{m_{X,Y,Z\otimes M}}\\ X\otimes((Y\otimes Z)\otimes M)\ar[rr]^{id\otimes m_{Y,Z,M}}&&X\otimes(Y% \otimes(Z\otimes M))}$ and $\xymatrix{(X\otimes{\bf 1})\otimes M\ar[rr]^{m_{X,{\bf 1},Y}}\ar[dr]^{r_{X}% \otimes id}&&X\otimes({\bf 1}\otimes M)\ar[dl]_{id\otimes l_{M}}\\ &X\otimes M&}$ commute.
Definition 2.1. A monoidal category consists of the following data: a category $\mathcal{C}$, a functor $\otimes:\mathcal{C}\otimes\mathcal{C}\to\mathcal{C}$, functorial isomorphisms $a_{X,Y,Z}:(X\otimes Y)\otimes Z\to X\otimes(Y\otimes Z)$, a unit object ${\bf 1}\in\mathcal{C}$, functorial isomorphisms $r_{X}:X\otimes{\bf 1}\to X$ and $l_{X}:{\bf 1}\otimes X\to X$ subject to the following axioms: 1) Pentagon axiom: the diagram $\xymatrix{&((X\otimes Y)\otimes Z)\otimes T\ar[dl]_{a_{X,Y,Z}\otimes id}\ar[dr% ]^{a_{X\otimes Y,Z,T}}&\\ (X\otimes(Y\otimes Z))\otimes T\ar[d]^{a_{X,Y\otimes Z,T}}&&(X\otimes Y)% \otimes(Z\otimes T)\ar[d]_{a_{X,Y,Z\otimes T}}\\ X\otimes((Y\otimes Z)\otimes T)\ar[rr]^{id\otimes a_{Y,Z,T}}&&X\otimes(Y% \otimes(Z\otimes T))}$ commutes. 2) Triangle axiom: the diagram $\xymatrix{(X\otimes{\bf 1})\otimes Y\ar[rr]^{a_{X,{\bf 1},Y}}\ar[dr]^{r_{X}% \otimes id}&&X\otimes({\bf 1}\otimes Y)\ar[dl]_{id\otimes l_{Y}}\\ &X\otimes Y&}$ commutes.
Definition 3.7. Let $\mathcal{M}$ be a $\mathcal{P}$-module category and $\omega$ a $\mathcal{P}$-module functor from $\mathcal{M}$ to the category of dualizable right modules over a ring $S$ in $\mathcal{P}$. Then we define: $L(\omega):=\int^{M\in\mathcal{M}}\mathrm{Hom}_{S}(\omega(M),S)\otimes_{k}% \omega(M).$ We will show that $L(\omega)$ has a natural structure of a coalgebroid over $S$ and we call it the associated coalgebroid of $\omega$.
Definition 2.5. (i) Let $\mathcal{M}_{1}$ and $\mathcal{M}_{2}$ be two module categories over a monoidal category $\mathcal{C}$. A module functor from $\mathcal{M}_{1}$ to $\mathcal{M}_{2}$ is a functor $F:\mathcal{M}_{1}\to\mathcal{M}_{2}$ together with functorial isomorphisms $c_{X,M}:F(X\otimes M)\to X\otimes F(M)$ for any $X\in\mathcal{C},\;M\in\mathcal{M}_{1}$ such that the diagrams $\xymatrix{&F((X\otimes Y)\otimes M)\ar[dl]_{Fm_{X,Y,M}}\ar[dr]^{c_{X\otimes Y}% }&\\ F(X\otimes(Y\otimes M))\ar[d]^{c_{X,Y\otimes M}}&&(X\otimes Y)\otimes F(M)\ar[% d]_{m_{X,Y,F(M)}}\\ X\otimes F(Y\otimes M)\ar[rr]^{id\otimes c_{Y,M}}&&X\otimes(Y\otimes F(M))}$ and $\xymatrix{F({\bf 1}\otimes M)\ar[rr]^{Fl_{M}}\ar[dr]^{c_{{\bf 1},M}}&&F(M)\\ &{\bf 1}\otimes F(M)\ar[ur]^{l_{F(M)}}&}$ are commutative. (ii) Two module categories $\mathcal{M}_{1}$ and $\mathcal{M}_{2}$ over $\mathcal{C}$ are equivalent if there exists a module functor from $\mathcal{M}_{1}$ to $\mathcal{M}_{2}$ which is an equivalence of categories.

Definition 2.12. Let $R$ be an algebra in a monoidal category $\mathcal{P}$ (it means that $R$ is an ind-object equipped with an associative product and a unit, when $R$ is an object of $\mathcal{P}$ we say that $R$ is finite) and $M$ be a right $R$-module in $\mathcal{P}$. Then $M$ is called finitely generated $R$-module if there is an epimorphism of right $R$-modules, $A\otimes R\to M$ for some $A\in\mathcal{P}$. The category of finitely generated $R$-modules is denoted by $\mathrm{Mod}(R)$ and is a module category over $\mathcal{P}$.
Definition 2.10. A module category $\mathcal{M}$ over $\mathcal{P}$ is said to have Chevalley property if for every two simple objects $P$ in $\mathcal{P}$ and $M$ in $\mathcal{M}$, $P\otimes M$ is semisimple. (This is a natural extension of the definition of Chevalley property for tensor categories, cf. [E], 4.12)
Definition 3.10. Let $F:\mathcal{C}\to\mathcal{D}$ be a functor from a category $\mathcal{C}$ to a $k$-linear category $\mathcal{D}$. The functor of framed objects, $\mathcal{H}:\mathcal{D}^{\mathrm{op}}\times\mathcal{D}\to\mathrm{ind}(\mathrm{% Vect}_{k})$ is defined by $\mathcal{H}(A,B)=\int^{X\in\mathcal{C}}\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathcal{D}}(A,F(X))% \otimes_{k}\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathcal{D}}(F(X),B).$
Definition 3.1. Let $S$ be an algebra in $\mathcal{P}$, then a right $S$-module $M$ is said to be dualizable if there is a left $S$-module $M^{*}$ with a natural equivalence: $\mathrm{Hom}_{S}(A\otimes M,N)\simeq\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathcal{P}}(A,N\otimes_{S}M% ^{*}),$ for any $A\in\mathcal{P}$ and any right $S$-module $N$.
Definition 2.6. Let $\mathcal{M}$ be a module category over $\mathcal{P}$ and $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$ be two objects of $\mathcal{M}$. Their internal hom is an ind-object $\underline{Hom}(M_{1},M_{2})$ of $\mathcal{P}$ representing functor $X\mapsto\mathrm{Hom}(X\otimes M_{1},M_{2})$.
Definition 2.2. (i) Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a monoidal category and $X$ be an object in $\mathcal{C}$. A right dual to $X$ is an object $X^{*}$ with two morphisms $e_{X}:X^{*}\otimes X\to{\bf 1},\;i_{X}:{\bf 1}\to X\otimes X^{*}$ such that the compositions $X\stackrel{{\scriptstyle i_{X}\otimes id}}{{\longrightarrow}}X\otimes X^{*}% \otimes X\stackrel{{\scriptstyle id\otimes e_{X}}}{{\longrightarrow}}X$ $X^{*}\stackrel{{\scriptstyle id\otimes i_{X}}}{{\longrightarrow}}X^{*}\otimes X% \otimes X^{*}\stackrel{{\scriptstyle e_{X}\otimes id}}{{\longrightarrow}}X^{*}$ are equal to the identity morphisms. (ii) A left dual to $X$ is an object ${}^{*}X$ with two morphisms $e_{X}^{\prime}:X\otimes{}^{*}X\to{\bf 1},\;i_{X}^{\prime}:{\bf 1}\to{}^{*}X\otimes X$ such that the compositions $X\stackrel{{\scriptstyle id\otimes i_{X}^{\prime}}}{{\longrightarrow}}X\otimes% {}^{*}X\otimes X\stackrel{{\scriptstyle e_{X}^{\prime}\otimes id}}{{% \longrightarrow}}X$ ${}^{*}X\stackrel{{\scriptstyle i_{X}^{\prime}\otimes id}}{{\longrightarrow}}{}% ^{*}X\otimes X\otimes{}^{*}X\stackrel{{\scriptstyle id\otimes e_{X}^{\prime}}}% {{\longrightarrow}}{}^{*}X$ are equal to the identity morphisms. (iii) A monoidal category $\mathcal{C}$ is called rigid if every object in $\mathcal{C}$ has right and left duals.
Definition 4.3. Let $(S,\tilde{m},\tilde{u})$ be a commutative algebra in $\mathcal{P}$, a commutative Hopf algebroid over $S$, is a coalgebroid $(L,\Delta,\epsilon)$ over $S$ equipped with unit and multiplication morphisms of coalgebroids over $S$: $u:S\otimes S\to L,\quad m:L\otimes_{S\otimes S}L\to L,$ such that $m$ is associative and commutative and $u$ is a unit for $m$. Furthermore there is a coalgebroid morphism $T:L^{op}\to L,$ called antipode with the following property: $\displaystyle L\xrightarrow{\Delta}L\otimes_{S}L\xrightarrow{}L^{op}\otimes_{S% \otimes S}L\xrightarrow{T\otimes id}L\otimes_{S\otimes S}L\xrightarrow{m}L=\\ \displaystyle L\xrightarrow{\epsilon}S\xrightarrow{\tilde{u}\otimes-}S\otimes S% \xrightarrow{u}L.$ In the special case $S=\bf 1$, a Hopf algebroid is called a Hopf algebra.
Definition 2.9. An abelian module category $\mathcal{M}$ over $\mathcal{P}$ is finitely generated over $\mathcal{P}$ if there exists an object $M$ in $\mathcal{M}$ such that every object of $\mathcal{M}$ is a subquotient of $P\otimes M$ for some object $P$ in $\mathcal{P}$.
Definition 3.6. Let $S$ be an algebra in $\mathcal{P}$. A coalgebroid $L$ over $S$ is a $(S,S)$-bimodule with two $(S,S)$-bimodule morphisms: $\Delta:L\to L\otimes_{S}L,\quad\epsilon:L\to S,$ such that $(\Delta\otimes id)\circ\Delta=(id\otimes\Delta)\circ\Delta,\quad id=(\epsilon% \otimes id)\circ\Delta=(id\otimes\epsilon)\circ\Delta.$ A comodule over $L$ is a right module $M$ over $S$ with a morphism of $S$-modules: $\rho:M\to M\otimes_{S}L,$ such that $(1\otimes\epsilon)\circ\rho=1,\quad(\rho\otimes 1)\circ\rho=(1\otimes\Delta)% \otimes\rho.$ The category of comodules over $L$ which are finitely generated over $S$ is denoted by $\mathrm{coMod}(L)$.
Definition 2.1. Let $G$ be a finite group. A $kG$-module $M$ is called a permutation module, if $M$ has a $G$-stable $k$-basis. A $p$-permutation $kG$-module is a $kG$-module $M$ such that $\mathrm{Res}^{G}_{S}M$ is a permutation $kS$-module for a Sylow $p$-subgroup $S$ of $G$.
Definition 2.3. (MD, , Definition 2.3.1) Let $(P,s)$ be a pair where $P$ is a $p$-group and $s$ is a generator of a $p^{\prime}$-cyclic group acting on $P$. We denote the semidirect product $P\rtimes\langle s\rangle$ by $\langle Ps\rangle$. Let $(Q,t)$ be another such pair. We say that the pairs $(P,s)$ and $(Q,t)$ are isomorphic if there are group isomorphisms $\phi:P\to Q$ and $\psi:\langle s\rangle\to\langle t\rangle$ such that $\psi(s)=q\cdot t$ for some $q\in Q$ and $\phi(s\cdot u)=\psi(s)\cdot\phi(u)$ for all $u\in P$. In that case we write $(P,s)\simeq(Q,t)$.
Definition 2.6. Let $\mathbb{F}pp_{k}^{\Delta}$ be the category with 1. objects: finite groups 2. $\mathrm{Mor}_{\mathbb{F}pp_{k}^{\Delta}}(G,H)=\mathbb{F}\otimes_{\mathbb{Z}}T^% {\Delta}(H,G)=\mathbb{F}T^{\Delta}(H,G)$.
Definition 5.2. For any pair $(P,s)$ let $\mathbf{e}_{P,s}$ denote the subfunctor of $\mathbb{F}T^{\Delta}$ generated by the idempotent $F^{\langle Ps\rangle}_{P,s}\in\mathbb{F}T^{\Delta}\big{(}\langle Ps\rangle\big% {)}$.
Definition 4.4. A pair $(P,s)$ is called $D^{\Delta}$-pair if $\mathrm{Def}^{\langle Ps\rangle}_{\langle Ps\rangle/N}F^{\langle Ps\rangle}_{P% ,s}=0$ for any nontrivial normal $p^{\prime}$-subgroup $N$ of $\langle Ps\rangle$.
Definition 3.8. The category $\overline{\mathrm{Ext}}(H,N)$ has (isomorphism classes of) extensions of $H$ by $N$ as objects and commutative diagrams of the form $N$$G$$H$$N$$G^{\prime}$$H$$k$$e$$k^{\prime}$$e^{\prime}$$f$ as morphisms. The meet-semilattice structure on $\mathrm{Hom}(G,G^{\prime})$ induces a meet-semilattice structure on the hom-sets of $\overline{\mathrm{Ext}}(H,N)$ and so, in particular, the category is order-enriched.
Definition 2.6. The Artin glueing of two frames $N$ and $H$ along a finite-meet preserving map $\alpha\colon H\to N$ is given by the frame $\operatorname{Gl}(\alpha)=\{(n,h)\in N\times H\mid n\leq\alpha(h)\}$ equipped with projections $\pi_{1}\colon\operatorname{Gl}(\alpha)\to N$ and $\pi_{2}\colon\operatorname{Gl}(\alpha)\to H$. Here the finite meet and arbitrary join operations in $\operatorname{Gl}(\alpha)$ are taken componentwise.
Definition 2.1. A diagram of the form ${N}$${G}$${H}$${k}$${e}$${s}$ is called a split extension if $k$ is the kernel of $e$, $e$ is the cokernel of $k$ and $s$ is a section of $e$. It is called an adjoint extension if furthermore, $s$ is right adjoint to $e$.
Definition 2.3. We say a morphism is a normal epimorphism if it occurs as the cokernel of some morphism. Dually, a monomorphism is a normal monomorphism if it occurs as the kernel of some morphism.
Definition 1.1.2. 1. For any $i\in{\mathbb{Z}}$ we will use the notation $\underline{C}_{t\leq i}$ (resp. $\underline{C}_{t\geq i}$) for the class $\underline{C}_{t\leq 0}[i]$ (resp. $\underline{C}_{t\geq 0}[i]$). 2. ${\underline{Ht}}$ is the full subcategory of $\underline{C}$ whose object class is $\underline{C}_{t=0}=\underline{C}_{t\leq 0}\cap\underline{C}_{t\geq 0}$. 3. We will say that $t$ is left (resp. right) non-degenerate if $\cap_{i\in{\mathbb{Z}}}\underline{C}_{t\geq i}=\{0\}$ (resp. $\cap_{i\in{\mathbb{Z}}}\underline{C}_{t\leq i}=\{0\}$). Moreover, we will say that $t$ is non-degenerate if it is both left and right non-degenerate. 4. We will say that $t$ is bounded below if $\cup_{i\in{\mathbb{Z}}}\underline{C}_{t\geq i}=\operatorname{Obj}\underline{C}$. Moreover, we will say that $t$ is bounded if the equality $\cup_{i\in{\mathbb{Z}}}\underline{C}_{t\leq i}=\operatorname{Obj}\underline{C}$ is valid as well. 5. Let $\underline{D}$ be a full triangulated subcategory of $\underline{C}$. We will say that $t$ restricts to $\underline{D}$ whenever the couple $t_{\underline{D}}=(\underline{C}_{t\leq 0}\cap\operatorname{Obj}\underline{D},% \ \underline{C}_{t\geq 0}\cap\operatorname{Obj}\underline{D})$ is a $t$-structure on $\underline{D}$.
Definition 2.1.1. Assume that $\underline{C}$ is endowed with a weight structure $w$, $n\in{\mathbb{Z}}$, and $\underline{A}$ is an abelian category. 1. Let $H$ be a cohomological functor from $\underline{C}$ into $\underline{A}$. We define the virtual $t$-truncation functors $\tau_{\leq n}(H)$ (resp. $\tau_{\geq n}(H)$) by the correspondence $M\mapsto\operatorname{\operatorname{Im}}(H(w_{\leq n+1}M)\to H(w_{\leq n}M));$ (resp. $M\mapsto\operatorname{\operatorname{Im}}(H(w_{\geq n}M)\to H(w_{\geq n-1}M))$); here we take arbitrary choices of the corresponding weight truncations of $M$ and connect them using Proposition 1.2.4(5) in the case $g=\operatorname{id}_{M}$. 2. Let $H^{\prime}:\underline{C}\to\underline{A}$ be a homological functor. Then we will write $\tau_{\leq n}(H^{\prime})$ for the correspondence $M\mapsto\operatorname{\operatorname{Im}}(H^{\prime}(w_{\leq n}M)\to H^{\prime}% (w_{\leq n+1}M))$ and $\tau_{\geq n}(H^{\prime})=M\mapsto\operatorname{\operatorname{Im}}(H^{\prime}(% w_{\geq n-1}M)\to H^{\prime}(w_{\geq n}M))$ (here we take the same connecting arrows between weight truncations of $M$ as above). 3. Assume that $\underline{C}$ is a full triangulated subcategory of a triangulated category $\underline{D}$. Then for any $M\in\operatorname{Obj}\underline{D}$ we will write $H_{M}=H_{M,\underline{C}}$ (resp. $H^{M}=H^{M}_{\underline{C}}$) for the restriction of the functor (co)represented by $M$ to $\underline{C}$ (thus $H_{M}$ and $H^{M}$ are functors from $\underline{C}$ into $\operatorname{Ab}$). Moreover, sometimes we will say that these functors are $\underline{D}$-Yoneda ones, and that $H_{M}$ (resp. $H^{M}$) is $\underline{D}$-(co)represented by $M$.
Definition 4.1.1. Let $\underline{C}$ be $R$-linear category. 1. We will say that an $R$-linear cohomological functor $H$ from $\underline{C}$ into $R-\operatorname{Mod}$ is (anti) locally finite whenever for any $M\in\operatorname{Obj}\underline{C}$ the $R$-module $H(M)$ is finitely presented and $(H(M[-i])=)H^{i}(M)=\{0\}$ for $i\ll 0$ (resp. for $i\gg 0$) Moreover, we will say that $H$ is finite if it is both locally and anti-locally finite. 2. We will say that $\underline{C}$ is $R$-saturated if the representable functors from $\underline{C}$ into $R-\operatorname{Mod}$ are exactly all the finite ones. 3. The symbol $\operatorname{\operatorname{Fun}_{R}}(C,D)$ will denote the (possibly, big) category of $R$-linear (additive) functors from $C$ into $D$ whenever $C$ and $D$ are $R$-linear categories. 4. We will write $R-\operatorname{mod}$ for the category of finitely presented $R$-modules (see Definition 4.4.11) below).
Definition 4.4.1. 1. We will say that a (left) $R$-module $M$ is finitely presented if there exists an exact sequence $P_{1}\to P_{0}\to M\to 0$ of $R$-modules, where $P_{i}$ are finitely generated $R$-projective. 2. We will say that $R$ is (left) coherent if any finitely generated left ideal of $R$ is finitely presented. 3. Moreover, $R$ is (left) semi-hereditary if any finitely generated left ideal of $R$ is projective. 4. We will use the notation $D(R)$ for the derived category of (left) $R$ modules. Moreover, we will write $D^{perf}(R)$ for the full subcategory of $D(R)$ of perfect complexes, i.e. its objects are quasi-isomorphic to bounded complexes of finitely generated projective $R$-modules.
Definition 1.1.1. A couple of subclasses $\underline{C}_{t\leq 0},\underline{C}_{t\geq 0}\subset\operatorname{Obj}% \underline{C}$ will be said to be a $t$-structure $t$ on $\underline{C}$ if they satisfy the following conditions: (i) $\underline{C}_{t\leq 0}$ and $\underline{C}_{t\geq 0}$ are strict, i.e., contain all objects of $\underline{C}$ isomorphic to their elements. (ii) $\underline{C}_{t\leq 0}\subset\underline{C}_{t\leq 0}[1]$ and $\underline{C}_{t\geq 0}[1]\subset\underline{C}_{t\geq 0}$. (iii) $\underline{C}_{t\geq 0}[1]\perp\underline{C}_{t\leq 0}$. (iv) For any $M\in\operatorname{Obj}\underline{C}$ there exists a $t$-decomposition distinguished triangle $L_{t}M\to M\to R_{t}M{\to}L_{t}M[1]$ such that $L_{t}M\in\underline{C}_{t\geq 0},R_{t}M\in\underline{C}_{t\leq 0}[-1]$. 2. ${\underline{Ht}}$ is the full subcategory of $\underline{C}$ whose object class is $\underline{C}_{t=0}=\underline{C}_{t\leq 0}\cap\underline{C}_{t\geq 0}$.
Definition 3.2.1. Let $\underline{C}$ be a smashing triangulated category, $\mathcal{P}$ is a subclass of $\operatorname{Obj}\underline{C}$, $\underline{C}^{\prime}$ is an arbitrary triangulated category, and $\mathcal{P}^{\prime}\subset\operatorname{Obj}\underline{C}^{\prime}$. 1. We will say that $\underline{C}$ satisfies the Brown representability property whenever any cp functor from $\underline{C}$ into $\operatorname{Ab}$ is representable. Dually, we will say that $\underline{C}^{\prime}$ satisfies the dual Brown representability property if $\underline{C}^{\prime}$ is smashing and any functor from $\underline{C}^{\prime}$ into $\operatorname{Ab}$ that respects products is corepresentable (i.e., if $\underline{C}^{\prime}{}^{op}$ satisfies the Brown representability assumption). 2. For an infinite cardinal $\alpha$ an object $M$ of $\underline{C}$ is said to be $\alpha$-small (in $\underline{C}$) if the functor $H^{M}=\underline{C}(M,-):\underline{C}\to\operatorname{Ab}$ is $\alpha$-small (see Definition 3.1.1(5)). Moreover, ${\aleph_{0}}$-small objects of $\underline{C}$ (corresponding to functors that respect coproducts) will also said to be compact. 3. We will say that a full strict triangulated subcategory $\underline{D}\subset\underline{C}$ is localizing whenever it is closed with respect to $\underline{C}$-coproducts. Respectively, we will call the smallest localizing subcategory of $\underline{C}$ that contains a given class $\mathcal{P}\subset\operatorname{Obj}\underline{C}$ the localizing subcategory of $\underline{C}$ generated by $\mathcal{P}$. 4. We will say that $\mathcal{P}$ compactly generates $\underline{C}$ and that $\underline{C}$ is compactly generated if $\mathcal{P}$ generates $\underline{C}$ as its own localizing subcategory and $\mathcal{P}$ is a set of compact objects of $\underline{C}$. Moreover, we will say that a subcategory $C$ of $\underline{C}$ compactly generates $\underline{C}$ whenever $C$ is essentially small and (any) its small skeleton compactly generates $\underline{C}$. 5. We will say that $\mathcal{P}^{\prime}$ generates a weight structure $w$ on $\underline{C}^{\prime}$ whenever $\underline{C}^{\prime}_{w\geq 0}=(\cup_{i>0}\mathcal{P}^{\prime}[-i]){}^{\perp}$. 6. We will say that $\mathcal{P}^{\prime}$ generates a $t$-structure $t$ on $\underline{C}^{\prime}$ whenever $\underline{C}^{\prime}_{t\leq 0}=(\cup_{i>0}\mathcal{P}^{\prime}[i]){}^{\perp}$.
Definition 5.2.5. For an abelian category $\underline{A}$ we will say that an increasing family of full strict abelian subcategories $\underline{A}_{\geq i}\subset\underline{A}$, $i\in{\mathbb{Z}}$, give a nice split filtration for $\underline{A}$ if $\cup_{i\in{\mathbb{Z}}}\operatorname{Obj}\underline{A}_{\geq i}=\operatorname{% Obj}\underline{A}$, $\cap_{i\in{\mathbb{Z}}}\operatorname{Obj}\underline{A}_{\geq i}=\{0\}$, and there exist exact left adjoints $W_{\geq i}$ to the embeddings $\underline{A}_{\leq i}\subset\underline{A}$.
