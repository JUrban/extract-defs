Definition 2.2.3. Let $(\mathcal{L},\mathcal{R})$ be a weak factorization system in a cocomplete category $\mathcal{M}$ and $\lambda$ a regular cardinal. (a) $(\mathcal{L},\mathcal{R})$ is called setwise cofibrantly generated if there is a generator $\mathcal{X}\subseteq\mathcal{L}$ for $\mathcal{R}$. (b) $(\mathcal{L},\mathcal{R})$ is called weakly cofibrantly generated if there is a generator $\mathcal{X}\subseteq\mathcal{L}$ for $\mathcal{R}$ such that $\mathcal{L}=\mathrm{cof}(\mathcal{X})$. In this case, $\mathcal{X}$ is called a generating set for $(\mathcal{L},\mathcal{R})$. (c) $(\mathcal{L},\mathcal{R})$ is called ($\lambda$-)cofibrantly generated if there is a generator $\mathcal{X}\subseteq\mathcal{L}$ for $\mathcal{R}$ such that the domains of the morphisms in $\mathcal{X}$ are ($\lambda$-)small relative to $\mathcal{X}$. (d) $(\mathcal{L},\mathcal{R})$ is called strictly ($\lambda$-)cofibrantly generated if there is a generator $\mathcal{X}\subseteq\mathcal{L}$ for $\mathcal{R}$ such that the domains of the morphisms in $\mathcal{X}$ are strictly ($\lambda$-)small relative to $\mathcal{X}$. (e) $(\mathcal{L},\mathcal{R})$ is called semi-perfectly ($\lambda$-)cofibrantly generated if there is a generator $\mathcal{X}\subseteq\mathcal{L}$ for $\mathcal{R}$ such that the domains of $\mathcal{X}$ are ($\lambda$-)presentable objects in $\mathcal{M}$. (f) $(\mathcal{L},\mathcal{R})$ is called perfectly ($\lambda$-)cofibrantly generated if there is a generator $\mathcal{X}\subseteq\mathcal{L}$ for $\mathcal{R}$ such that the domains and codomains of $\mathcal{X}$ are ($\lambda$-)presentable objects in $\mathcal{M}$.
Definition 2.2.1. Let $(\mathcal{L},\mathcal{R})$ be a weak factorization system in $\mathcal{M}$. A set of morphisms $\mathcal{X}\subseteq\mathcal{L}$ is called a generator for $\mathcal{R}$ if $\mathcal{X}^{\square}=\mathcal{R}$.
Definition 5. Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a category equipped with a costable factorisation system $(\mathcal{E},\mathcal{M})$. We define $\square\colon\mathsf{Cospan}(\mathcal{C})\to\mathsf{Corel}(\mathcal{C})$ as the ioo functor mapping the isomorphism class of cospans represented by $X\xrightarrow{f}N\xleftarrow{g}Y$ to the corelation represented by this cospan.
Definition 3. • Given a category $\mathcal{C}$ with pullbacks, the category $\mathsf{Span}(\mathcal{C})$ has the same objects as $\mathcal{C}$ and arrows $X\to Y$ isomorphism classes of spans $X\xleftarrow{f}\xrightarrow{g}Y$ in $\mathcal{C}$. The composite of $X\xleftarrow{f}\xrightarrow{g}Y$ and $Y\xleftarrow{h}\xrightarrow{i}Z$ is obtained by taking the pullback of $\xrightarrow{g}\xleftarrow{h}$. • Given a category $\mathcal{C}$ with pushouts, the category $\mathsf{Cospan}(\mathcal{C})$ has the same objects as $\mathcal{C}$ and arrows $X\to Y$ isomorphism classes of cospans $X\xrightarrow{f}\xleftarrow{g}Y$ in $\mathcal{C}$. The composite of $X\xrightarrow{f}\xleftarrow{g}Y$ and $Y\xrightarrow{h}\xleftarrow{i}Z$ is obtained by taking the pushout of $\xleftarrow{g}\xrightarrow{h}$.
Definition 1. A factorisation system $(\mathcal{E},\mathcal{M})$ in a category $\mathcal{C}$ comprises subcategories $\mathcal{E}$, $\mathcal{M}$ of $\mathcal{C}$ such that 1. $\mathcal{E}$ and $\mathcal{M}$ contain all isomorphisms of $\mathcal{C}$. 2. every morphism $f\in\mathcal{C}$ admits a factorisation $f=m\circ e$, $e\in\mathcal{E}$, $m\in\mathcal{M}$. 3. given morphisms $f,f^{\prime}$, with factorisations $f=m\circ e$, $f^{\prime}=m^{\prime}\circ e^{\prime}$ of the above sort, for every $u$, $v$ such that $v\circ f=f^{\prime}\circ u$ there exists a unique morphism $s$ such that $\xymatrixcolsep{3pc}\xymatrixrowsep{3pc}\xymatrix{\ar[r]^{e}\ar[d]_{u}&\ar[r]^% {m}\ar@{-->}[d]^{\exists!s}&\ar[d]^{v}\\ \ar[r]_{e^{\prime}}&\ar[r]_{m^{\prime}}&}$ commutes.
Definition 4. • Given a category $\mathcal{C}$ with pullbacks and a stable factorisation system $(\mathcal{E},\mathcal{M})$, the category $\mathsf{Rel}(\mathcal{C})$ has the same objects as $\mathcal{C}$. For arrows $X\to Y$ equivalence classes of spans $X\xleftarrow{f}N\xrightarrow{g}Y$ under the transitive closure of the following relation: two spans $X\xleftarrow{f}N\xrightarrow{g}Y$ and $X\xleftarrow{f^{\prime}}N^{\prime}\xrightarrow{g^{\prime}}Y$ equivalent if there exists $N^{\prime}\xrightarrow{e}N$ in $\mathcal{E}$ such that the following diagram diagram commutes. $\xymatrix@R=5pt{&N^{\prime}\ar[dl]_{f^{\prime}}\ar[dr]^{g^{\prime}}\ar[dd]^{e}% \\ X&&Y\\ &N\ar[ul]^{f}\ar[ur]_{g}}$ This notion of equivalence respects composition of spans, and so $\mathsf{Rel}(\mathcal{C})$ is indeed a category. We call the morphisms in this category relations. • Given a category $\mathcal{C}$ with pushouts and a costable factorisation system $(\mathcal{E},\mathcal{M})$, we can dualise the above to define the category $\mathsf{Corel}(\mathcal{C})$ of corelations.
Definition 2. Given a category $\mathcal{C}$, we say that a subcategory $\mathcal{A}$ is stable under pushout (resp. pullback) if for every pushout square (resp. pullback square) $\xymatrix{\ar[r]^{a}\ar[d]&\ar[d]\\ \ar[r]^{f}&{}\save*!/dr+1.2pc/dr:(1,-1)@^{|-}\restore}$ such that $a\in\mathcal{A}$, we also have that $f\in\mathcal{A}$.
Definition 10.1. A tropical semiring is the commutative semiring $(M,\min,\infty,+,0)$ obtained from a totally ordered commutative monoid $(M,+,0,\leq)$ having an absorbing element $\infty$ which is larger than all elements in the monoid. In the tropical semiring, $\min$ is the addition, $\infty$ is the additive unit, $+$ is the multiplication and $0$ is the multiplicative unit. The nomenclature is extended to semirings isomorphic to the explicitly min-plus semirings used above (e.g. max-plus formulations, or the Viterbi semiring).
Definition 2.1 ($R$-probabilistic Theory). An $R$-probabilistic theory is a symmetric monoidal category $\mathcal{C}$ which satisfies the following requirements. (i) There is a full sub-SMC of $\mathcal{C}$, denoted by $\mathcal{C}_{K}$, which is equivalent to $R\operatorname{-Mat}$. (ii) The SMC $\mathcal{C}$ is enriched in commutative monoids, and the enrichment on the subcategory $\mathcal{C}_{K}$ coincides with the one given by the linear structure of $R\operatorname{-Mat}$. (iii) The SMC $\mathcal{C}$ comes with an environment structure, i.e. with a family $(\hbox{\leavevmode\hbox to16.9pt{\vbox to15.3pt{\pgfpicture\makeatletter\hbox t% o 0.0pt{\pgfsys@beginscope\pgfsys@invoke{ }\definecolor{pgfstrokecolor}{rgb}{% 0,0,0}\pgfsys@color@rgb@stroke{0}{0}{0}\pgfsys@invoke{ }\pgfsys@color@rgb@fill% {0}{0}{0}\pgfsys@invoke{ }\pgfsys@setlinewidth{0.4pt}\pgfsys@invoke{ }% \nullfont\pgfsys@beginscope\pgfsys@invoke{ }\pgfsys@invoke{\lxSVG@closescope }% \pgfsys@endscope\pgfsys@beginscope\pgfsys@invoke{ }\pgfsys@invoke{% \lxSVG@closescope }\pgfsys@endscope\hbox to 0.0pt{\pgfsys@beginscope% \pgfsys@invoke{ } \par \par{}{{}}{} {}{{}}{}{}{}{}{{}}{} \par {{}}{{}}{{}}{{}}\hbox{\hbox{{\pgfsys@beginscope\pgfsys@invoke{ }% \pgfsys@setlinewidth{0.8pt}\pgfsys@invoke{ }{{}{}{{ {}{}}}{ {}{}} {{}{}} {{}{{}}} {} {} {} {} {} {} {\pgfsys@beginscope\pgfsys@invoke{ }\pgfsys@setlinewidth{0.8pt}\pgfsys@invoke{% }{}\pgfsys@moveto{0.591998pt}{-5.25pt}\pgfsys@lineto{0.591998pt}{5.25pt}% \pgfsys@moveto{2.560748pt}{-3.50007pt}\pgfsys@lineto{2.560748pt}{3.50007pt}% \pgfsys@moveto{4.529498pt}{-1.75014pt}\pgfsys@lineto{4.529498pt}{1.75014pt}% \pgfsys@stroke\pgfsys@invoke{ } \pgfsys@invoke{\lxSVG@closescope }\pgfsys@endscope}{{{{}}\pgfsys@beginscope% \pgfsys@invoke{ }\pgfsys@transformcm{0.75}{0.0}{0.0}{0.75}{2.560748pt}{0.0pt}% \pgfsys@invoke{ }\hbox{{\definecolor{pgfstrokecolor}{rgb}{0,0,0}% \pgfsys@color@rgb@stroke{0}{0}{0}\pgfsys@invoke{ }\pgfsys@color@rgb@fill{0}{0}% {0}\pgfsys@invoke{ }\hbox{} }}\pgfsys@invoke{\lxSVG@closescope }\pgfsys@endscope}}} \pgfsys@invoke{\lxSVG@closescope }\pgfsys@endscope}}} {{}}\hbox{\hbox{{\pgfsys@beginscope\pgfsys@invoke{ }{{}{}{{ {}{}}}{ {}{}} {{}{{}}}{{}{}}{}{{}{}}{}{}{}{}{} { }{{{{}}\pgfsys@beginscope\pgfsys@invoke{ }\pgfsys@transformcm{0.0}{-0.6}{0.6}{% 0.0}{-5.975079pt}{0.0pt}\pgfsys@invoke{ }\hbox{{\definecolor{pgfstrokecolor}{% rgb}{0,0,0}\pgfsys@color@rgb@stroke{0}{0}{0}\pgfsys@invoke{ }% \pgfsys@color@rgb@fill{0}{0}{0}\pgfsys@invoke{ }\hbox{} }}\pgfsys@invoke{\lxSVG@closescope }\pgfsys@endscope}}} \pgfsys@invoke{\lxSVG@closescope }\pgfsys@endscope}}} { {}{}{}{}}{}{ {}{}{}{}} {{{{{}}{ {}{}}{}{}{{}{}}}{}}}{}{{{{{}}{}{ {}{}}{}{}{{}{}}}{}}}{{}}{}{}{}{}\pgfsys@moveto{-3.85528pt}{0.0pt}% \pgfsys@lineto{0.291998pt}{0.0pt}\pgfsys@stroke\pgfsys@invoke{ } \par \pgfsys@invoke{\lxSVG@closescope }\pgfsys@endscope{}{}{}\hss}% \pgfsys@discardpath\pgfsys@invoke{\lxSVG@closescope }\pgfsys@endscope\hss}% \lxSVG@closescope\endpgfpicture}} }\!_{\mathcal{H}}:\mathcal{H}\rightarrow\textbf{1})_{\mathcal{H}\in% \operatorname{obj}\,\mathcal{C}}$ of morphisms which satisfy the following requirements: $=$$\mathcal{H}\otimes\mathcal{G}$$\mathcal{H}$$\mathcal{G}$$R^{\textbf{1}}$$=$ On the subcategory $\mathcal{C}_{K}$, this environment structure must coincide with the canonical one of $R\operatorname{-Mat}$. We refer to $\mathcal{C}_{K}$ as classical theory, and to its objects and morphisms as classical systems and processes. As diagrammatic convention, we use dashed wires for classical systems, and solid wires for generic ones.
Definition 3.1. Let $S$ be a commutative semiring with involution. Then we define its sub-semiring of positive elements $R$ to be the closure under addition in $S$ of the set $\left\{x^{\ast}x\>\middle|\>x\in S\right\}$.
Definition 4.3. A tree $T$ is said to be closed if it has no leaves, that is, if there is a vertex above every edge of $T$. The full subcategory of $\Omega$ consisting of closed trees is denoted by $\overline{\Omega}$.
Definition 1.4. Let $A$ be a small category. (a) The category $A$ is said to be a weak test category if, for every small category $C$, the counit functor $\varepsilon_{C}:i_{A}i^{\ast}_{A}C\to C$ is a weak equivalence. (b) The category $A$ is said to be a local test category if, for every object $a$ of $A$, the slice category $A/a$ is a weak test category. (c) The category $A$ is said to be a test category if it is both a weak test category and a local test category.
Definition 1.1.3. Let $M$ be a module in $\operatorname{Mod}(R)$ and $N$ be a module in $\operatorname{Mod}(R{}^{\operatorname{op}})$. (a) $M$ is called absolutely clean (or weak injective) if $\operatorname{Ext}_{R}^{1}(L,M)=0$ for all $L\in\mbox{FP}_{\infty}(R)$. (b) $N$ is called level (or weak flat) if $\operatorname{Tor}^{R}_{1}(N,L)=0$ for all $L\in\mbox{FP}_{\infty}(R)$.
Definition 1.1.6. A complex $\bm{X}$ is said to be of type $\mbox{FP}_{\infty}$ (or, super finitely presented) if there exists an exact sequence $\cdots\to\bm{P_{n}}\to\bm{P_{n-1}}\to\cdots\to\bm{P_{1}}\to\bm{P_{0}}\to\bm{X}% \to\bm{0}$ in $\operatorname{Ch}(R)$, where each $\bm{P_{i}}$ is finitely generated projective.

A complex $\bm{X}$ in $\operatorname{Ch}(R)$ is said to be of type $\mbox{FP}_{n}$ if there is an exact sequence $\displaystyle\bm{P_{n}}\to\bm{P_{n-1}}\to\cdots\to\bm{P_{1}}\to\bm{P_{0}}\to% \bm{X}\to\bm{0}$ in $\operatorname{Ch}(R)$, where each $\bm{P_{i}}$ is finitely generated projective.
Definition 3.2.2. (a) The $\mbox{FP}_{n}$-injective dimension of a complex $\bm{X}$ in $\operatorname{Ch}(R)$, denoted $\mbox{FP}_{n}\mbox{-}\operatorname{id}(\bm{X})$, is defined as the smallest non-negative integer $k\geq 0$ such that $\bm{X}$ has a coresolution by $\mbox{FP}_{n}$-injective complexes, as (3.3), with $\bm{E^{i}}=\bm{0}$ for every $i>k$. If such $k$ does not exist, we set $\mbox{FP}_{n}\mbox{-}\operatorname{id}(\bm{X}):=\infty$. (b) The $\mbox{FP}_{n}$-flat dimension of a complex $\bm{Y}$ in $\operatorname{Ch}(R{}^{\operatorname{op}})$, denoted $\mbox{FP}_{n}\mbox{-}\mathop{\rm fd}\nolimits(\bm{Y})$, is defined as the smallest non-negative integer $t\geq 0$ such that $\bm{Y}$ has a resolution by $\mbox{FP}_{n}$-flat complexes, as (3.4), with $\bm{Q_{i}}=\bm{0}$ for every $i>t$. If such $t$ does not exist, we set $\mbox{FP}_{n}\mbox{-}\mathop{\rm fd}\nolimits(\bm{Y}):=\infty$.
Definition 1.1.8. A module $M$ in $\operatorname{Mod}(R)$ is called of type $\mbox{FP}_{n}$ (or finitely $n$-presented) if there exists an exact sequence $\displaystyle P_{n}$ $\displaystyle\to P_{n-1}\to\cdots\to P_{1}\to P_{0}\to M\to 0$ in $\operatorname{Mod}(R)$ where each $P_{i}$ is finitely generated and projective.
Definition 2.3.1. Let $\bm{X}$ be a complex in $\operatorname{Ch}(R)$ and $\bm{Y}$ be a complex in $\operatorname{Ch}(R{}^{\operatorname{op}})$. We say that: (a) $\bm{X}$ is $\mbox{FP}_{n}$-injective if $\underline{\operatorname{Ext}}^{1}(\bm{L},\bm{X})=\bm{0}$ for every $\bm{L}\in\mathscr{FP}_{n}(R)$. (b) $\bm{Y}$ is $\mbox{FP}_{n}$-flat if $\overline{\operatorname{Tor}}_{1}(\bm{Y},\bm{L})=\bm{0}$ for every $\bm{L}\in\mathscr{FP}_{n}(R)$.

(a) $M$ is called $\mbox{FP}_{n}$-injective if $\operatorname{Ext}_{R}^{1}(L,M)=0$ for all $L\in\mathcal{FP}_{n}(R)$. (b) $N$ is called $\mbox{FP}_{n}$-flat if ${\operatorname{Tor}}_{1}^{R}(N,L)=0$ for all $L\in\mathcal{FP}_{n}(R)$.
Definition 1.1.2. A module $L$ in $\operatorname{Mod}(R)$ is said to be of type $\mbox{FP}_{\infty}$ (or super finitely presented) if there exists an exact sequence $\cdots\to P_{n}\to P_{n-1}\to\cdots\to P_{1}\to P_{0}\to L\to 0$ in $\operatorname{Mod}(R)$, where each $P_{i}$ is finitely generated projective.
Definition 1.1.4. (a) A graded set $G$ is a family of sets $\{G_{m}\mbox{ : }m\in\mathbb{Z}\}$ such that $G_{m}\cap G_{n}=\emptyset$ whenever $m\neq n$. If $G$ and $H$ are graded sets, a morphism $f\colon G\to H$ of degree $p$ is a family of functions of the form $f_{m}\colon G_{m}\to H_{m+p}$ with $m\in\mathbb{Z}$. Given a graded set $G$ and a complex $\bm{X}$ in $\operatorname{Ch}(R)$, the notation $G\subseteq\bm{X}$ means $G_{n}\subseteq X_{n}$ for every $n\in\mathbb{Z}$. In this case, a sub-complex $\bm{Y}\subseteq\bm{X}$ is the sub-complex generated by $G$ if $\bm{Y}$ is the intersection of all sub-complexes of $\bm{X}$ containing $G$. A complex $\bm{X}$ is said to be finitely generated if one of the following equivalent conditions is satisfied: (a.1) There exists a finite graded set $G\subseteq\bm{X}$ that generates $\bm{X}$. (a.2) Whenever $\bm{X}=\sum_{i\in I}\bm{S}^{i}$ for some collection $\{\bm{S}^{i}\}_{i\in I}$ of sub-complexes of $\bm{X}$, then there exists a finite subset $J\subseteq I$ for which $\bm{X}=\sum_{i\in J}\bm{S}^{i}$ (b) A complex $\bm{X}$ is called finitely presented if $\bm{X}$ is finitely generated and for each short exact sequence $\bm{0}\to\bm{K}\to\bm{Y}\to\bm{X}\to\bm{0}$ in $\operatorname{Ch}(R)$ with $\bm{Y}$ finitely generated projective, $\bm{K}$ is also finitely generated; or equivalently, if there is an exact sequence $\bm{P_{1}}\to\bm{P_{0}}\to\bm{X}\to\bm{0}$ in $\operatorname{Ch}(R)$ such that $\bm{P_{0}}$ and $\bm{P_{1}}$ are finitely generated and projective.
Definition 2.1.2. A complex $\bm{F}$ is called free if there exists a graded set $B\subseteq\bm{F}$ such that for any complex $\bm{X}$ and any morphism $B\to\bm{X}$ of degree $0$, there exists a unique morphism $\bm{F}\to\bm{X}$ of complexes that agrees with $B\to\bm{X}$.
Definition 1.1.7. Let $\bm{X}$ be a complex in $\operatorname{Ch}(R)$ and $\bm{Y}$ a complex in $\operatorname{Ch}(R{}^{\operatorname{op}})$. (a) $\bm{X}$ is called FP-injective if $\underline{\operatorname{Ext}}^{1}(\bm{L},\bm{X})=\bm{0}$ for all finitely presented $\bm{L}$ in $\operatorname{Ch}(R)$. (b) $\bm{X}$ is called absolutely clean (or weak injective) if $\underline{\operatorname{Ext}}^{1}(\bm{L},\bm{X})=\bm{0}$ for all $\bm{L}\in\mathscr{FP}_{\infty}(R)$. (c) $\bm{Y}$ is called level (or weak flat) if $\overline{\operatorname{Tor}}_{1}(\bm{Y},\bm{L})=\bm{0}$ for all $\bm{L}\in\mathscr{FP}_{\infty}(R)$.
Definition 3.1.1. (a) The $\mbox{FP}_{n}$-injective dimension of a module $M$ in $\operatorname{Mod}(R)$, denoted $\mbox{FP}_{n}\mbox{-}\operatorname{id}_{R}(M)$, is defined as the smallest non-negative integer $k\geq 0$ such that $M$ has a coresolution by $\mbox{FP}_{n}$-injective modules, as (3.1), with $E^{i}=0$ for every $i>k$. If such $k$ does not exist, we set $\mbox{FP}_{n}\mbox{-}\operatorname{id}_{R}(M):=\infty$. (b) The $\mbox{FP}_{n}$-flat dimension of a module $N$ in $\operatorname{Mod}(R{}^{\operatorname{op}})$, denoted $\mbox{FP}_{n}\mbox{-}\mathop{\rm fd}\nolimits_{R{}^{\operatorname{op}}}(N)$, is defined as the smallest non-negative integer $t\geq 0$ such that $N$ has a resolution by $\mbox{FP}_{n}$-flat modules, as (3.2), with $Q_{i}=0$ for every $i>t$. If such $t$ does not exist, we set $\mbox{FP}_{n}\mbox{-}\mathop{\rm fd}\nolimits_{R{}^{\operatorname{op}}}(N):=\infty$.
Definition 2.1.8. A ring $R$ is called left $n$-coherent if each module of type $\mbox{FP}_{n}$ in $\operatorname{Mod}(R)$ is of type $\mbox{FP}_{n+1}$, that is, $\mathcal{FP}_{n}(R)\subseteq\mathcal{FP}_{n+1}(R)$.
Definition 2.9. $\mathcal{D}$ as in Theorem 2.8 is called factorisable if it satisfies the equivalent conditions 1–4 there.
Definition 5.4. A $k$-linear additive category $\mathcal{K}$ with finite-dimensional Hom-spaces is called Calabi-Yau if it is equipped with a family of $k$-linear maps (the trace maps) $\big{(}\,\mathsf{t}_{M}:\operatorname{End}(M)\to k\,\big{)}_{M\in\mathcal{K}}$ such that for all $M,N\in\mathcal{K}$, 1. (cyclicity) for all $f:M\to N$, $g:N\to M$ we have $\mathsf{t}_{M}(g\circ f)=\mathsf{t}_{N}(f\circ g)$. 2. (non-degeneracy) the pairing $(-,-):\mathcal{K}(M,N)\times\mathcal{K}(N,M)\to k$, $(f,g)=\mathsf{t}_{N}(f\circ g)$ is non-degenerate. We denote by $\mathrm{CY}(\mathcal{K})$ the set of all families of trace maps $(\mathsf{t}_{M})_{M\in\mathcal{K}}$ which turn $\mathcal{K}$ into a Calabi-Yau category.
Definition 2.5. For a given $\omega\in{\Omega}$ and $\lambda\in{\bf k}$, we say that the triple $(R,d,Q)$ is a type $\omega$ operated differential algebra of weight $\lambda$ if (i) $(R,d)$ is a differential algebra of weight $\lambda$, (ii) $(R,Q)$ is an operated algebra, and (iii) $\omega(d,Q)=0$, that is, $dQ=\phi(d)+Q\psi(d).$
Definition 3.5. For a given $\omega\in{\Omega}$ and $\lambda\in{\bf k}$, we say that the triple $(R,d,P)$ is a type $\omega$ differential Rota-Baxter algebra of weight $\lambda$ if (i) $(R,d)$ is a differential algebra of weight $\lambda$, (ii) $(R,P)$ is a Rota-Baxter algebra of weight $\lambda$, and (iii) $\omega(d,P)=0$, that is, $dP=\phi(d)+P\psi(d).$
Definition 2.9. For a given $\omega\in{\Omega}$ and $\lambda\in{\bf k}$, we say that the triple $(R,q,P)$ is a type $\omega$ operated Rota-Baxter algebra of weight $\lambda$ if (i) $(R,q)$ is an operated algebra with the property $q({\bf 1}_{R})=0$, (ii) $(R,P)$ is a Rota-Baxter algebra of weight $\lambda$, and (iii) $\omega(q,P)=0$, that is, $qP=\phi(q)+P\psi(q).$
Definition 3.14. Let a category $\mathbf{A}$, a monad ${\mathbf{T}}=\langle T,\eta,\mu\rangle$ and a comonad $\mathbf{C}=\langle C,\varepsilon,\delta\rangle$ on $\mathbf{A}$ be given. A mixed distributive law of $\mathbf{T}$ over $\mathbf{C}$ is a natural transformation $\beta:TC\rightarrow CT$ satisfying the following conditions. (i) $\beta\circ\eta C=C\eta$; (ii) $\varepsilon T\circ\beta=T\varepsilon$; (iii) $\delta T\circ\beta=C\beta\circ\beta C\circ T\delta$; (iv) $\beta\circ\mu C=C\mu\circ\beta T\circ T\beta$.
Definition 2.6. For a given operator $Q:R\to R$, we call an operator $\widehat{Q}:R^{\mathbb{N}}\to R^{\mathbb{N}}$ a coextension of $Q$ to $R^{\mathbb{N}}$ if for all $f\in R^{\mathbb{N}}$, we have $\widehat{Q}_{0}(f)=Q(f_{0})$.
Definition 2.10. For a given operator $q:R\to R$ satisfying $q({\bf 1}_{R})=0$, we call an operator $\hat{q}:{\mbox{\cyr X}}(R)\to{\mbox{\cyr X}}(R)$ an extension of $q$ to ${\mbox{\cyr X}}(R)$ if $\hat{q}|_{R}=q$, that is, $\hat{q}_{1}=q$.
Definition 2.1. (1) A model category is cofibrantly generated if there are a set $I$ of cofibrations and a set $J$ of trivial cofibrations (i.e., maps that are both cofibrations and weak equivalences) that permit the small object argument (with respect to some cardinal $\kappa$), and a map is a (trivial) fibration if and only if it satisfies the right lifting property with respect to all maps in $J$ (resp., $I$). (2) A symmetric monoidal closed category $\mathsf{M}$ equipped with a model structure is called a monoidal model category if it satisfies the following pushout product axiom [SS00] (3.1): • Given any cofibrations $f:X_{0}\hskip-2.845276pt\SelectTips{cm}{10}\xymatrix@C-.3cm{\ar[r]&}\hskip-2.8% 45276ptX_{1}$ and $g:Y_{0}\hskip-2.845276pt\SelectTips{cm}{10}\xymatrix@C-.3cm{\ar[r]&}\hskip-2.8% 45276ptY_{1}$, the pushout product map $\SelectTips{cm}{10}\xymatrix@C+10pt@R+8pt{(X_{0}\otimes Y_{1})\underset{X_{0}% \otimes Y_{0}}{\coprod}(X_{1}\otimes Y_{0})\ar[r]^{-}{f\mathbin{\square}g}&X_{% 1}\otimes Y_{1}}$ is a cofibration. If, in addition, either $f$ or $g$ is a weak equivalence then $f\mathbin{\square}g$ is a trivial cofibration.
Definition 2.2. (1) Given a solid-arrow commutative diagram $\SelectTips{cm}{10}\xymatrix@C+10pt@R+8pt@R-.5cm{A\ar[d]\ar[r]\ar@{}[dr]|-{% \mathrm{pushout}}&C\ar[d]\ar@/^{1}pc/[ddr]|-{g}&\\ B\ar[r]\ar@/_{1}pc/[drr]|-{f}&B\underset{A}{\coprod}C\ar@{}[dr]^{(}.15){}="a"^% {(}.9){}="b"\ar@{.>}"a";"b"|-{f\circledast g}&\\ &&D}$ in $\mathsf{M}$ in which the square is a pushout, the unique dotted induced map–i.e., the pushout corner map–will be denoted by $f\circledast g$. The only exception to this notation is when the pushout corner map is actually a pushout product of two maps, in which case we keep the box notation in Def. 2.1. (2) The arrow category $\overrightarrow{\mathsf{M}}$ is the category whose objects are maps in $\mathsf{M}$, in which a map $\alpha:f\hskip-2.845276pt\SelectTips{cm}{10}\xymatrix@C-.3cm{\ar[r]&}\hskip-2.% 845276ptg$ is a commutative square $\SelectTips{cm}{10}\xymatrix@C+10pt@R+8pt@R-10pt{X_{0}\ar[r]^{-}{\alpha_{0}}% \ar[d]_{f}&Y_{0}\ar[d]^{-}{g}\\ X_{1}\ar[r]^{-}{\alpha_{1}}&Y_{1}}$ in $\mathsf{M}$. We will also write $\operatorname{Ev}_{0}f=X_{0}$, $\operatorname{Ev}_{1}f=X_{1}$, $\operatorname{Ev}_{0}\alpha=\alpha_{0}$, and $\operatorname{Ev}_{1}\alpha=\alpha_{1}$. (3) The pushout product monoidal structure on $\overrightarrow{\mathsf{M}}$ is given by the pushout product $\SelectTips{cm}{10}\xymatrix@C+10pt@R+8pt{(X_{0}\otimes Y_{1})\underset{X_{0}% \otimes Y_{0}}{\coprod}(X_{1}\otimes Y_{0})\ar[r]^{-}{f\mathbin{\square}g}&X_{% 1}\otimes Y_{1}}$ for $f:X_{0}\hskip-2.845276pt\SelectTips{cm}{10}\xymatrix@C-.3cm{\ar[r]&}\hskip-2.8% 45276ptX_{1}$ and $g:Y_{0}\hskip-2.845276pt\SelectTips{cm}{10}\xymatrix@C-.3cm{\ar[r]&}\hskip-2.8% 45276ptY_{1}$. The arrow category equipped with this monoidal structure is denoted by $\overrightarrow{\mathsf{M}}^{\square}$. Its monoidal unit is $\varnothing\hskip-2.845276pt\SelectTips{cm}{10}\xymatrix@C-.3cm{\ar[r]&}\hskip% -2.845276pt\mathbb{1}$, and it is a symmetric monoidal closed category. (4) Defining $L_{0}(X)=(\operatorname{Id}:X\hskip-2.845276pt\SelectTips{cm}{10}\xymatrix@C-.% 3cm{\ar[r]&}\hskip-2.845276ptX)$ and $L_{1}(X)=(\varnothing\hskip-2.845276pt\SelectTips{cm}{10}\xymatrix@C-.3cm{\ar[% r]&}\hskip-2.845276ptX)$ for $X\in\mathsf{M}$, there are adjunctions $\SelectTips{cm}{10}\xymatrix@C+10pt@R+8pt{\mathsf{M}\ar@<2pt>[r]^{-}{L_{0}}&% \overrightarrow{\mathsf{M}}\ar@<2pt>[l]^{-}{\operatorname{Ev}_{0}}&\mathsf{M}% \ar@<2pt>[r]^{-}{L_{1}}&\overrightarrow{\mathsf{M}}\ar@<2pt>[l]^{-}{% \operatorname{Ev}_{1}}}$ with left adjoints on top.
Definition 3.9. We say that $\mathcal{C}$ is dominated by $\{{V_{i}\}}$ and $\{{f_{j}\}}$ if any tensor functor $F$ from $\mathcal{C}$ to any tensor category $\mathcal{E}$ is determined by $\{{F(V_{i})\}}$ and $\{{F(f_{j})\}}$ up to an isomorphism. We say that $\mathcal{C}$ is finitely dominated if it is dominated by a finite collection of objects and morphisms.
Definition 3.4. A co-twisted automorphism of $H$ is a pair $(\alpha,J)$, where $\alpha:H\to H$ is a coalgebra automorphism, and $J\in(H\otimes H)^{*}$ is a Hopf 2-cocycle such that $\alpha(x*y)=\alpha(x)*_{J}\alpha(y)$, where $*_{J}$ is the product twisted by $J$.
Definition 1.1. A coalgebra $C$ is called right (left) quasi-co-Frobenius, or shortly right QcF coalgebra, if there is a monomorphism $C\hookrightarrow(C^{*})^{(I)}$ of right (left) $C^{*}$-modules. $C$ is called QcF coalgebra if it is both a left and right QcF coalgebra.
Definition 1.5. (i) Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a category having products. We say that $M,N\in\mathcal{C}$ are weakly $\pi$-isomorphic if and only if there are some sets $I,J$ such that $M^{I}\simeq N^{J}$; we write $M\stackrel{{\scriptstyle\pi}}{{\sim}}N$. (ii) Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a category having coproducts. We say that $M,N\in\mathcal{C}$ are weakly $\sigma$-isomorphic if and only if there are some sets $I,J$ such that $M^{(I)}\simeq N^{(J)}$; we write $M\stackrel{{\scriptstyle\sigma}}{{\sim}}N$.
1 Definition. A couple (of quantales) consists of two quantales $C,Q$ together with a coupling map $\phi:C\to Q$ such that $C$ is also a $Q$-bimodule, $\phi$ is a $Q$-bimodule homomorphism, and $\phi(c_{1})c_{2}=c_{1}\phi(c_{2})=c_{1}c_{2}$ holds for all $c_{1},c_{2}\in C$. Assume that $C\stackrel{{\scriptstyle\phi}}{{\to}}Q$ is a couple. An element $d\in C$ is said to be cyclic if $ac\leq d\Leftrightarrow ca\leq d$ for all $a\in Q,c\in C$. The element $d$ is said to be dualizing if $d\leftarrow(a\rightarrow d)=(d\leftarrow a)\rightarrow d=a$ for all $a\in Q$ and $d\leftarrow(c\rightarrow d)=(d\leftarrow c)\rightarrow d=c$ for all $c\in C$. In the case where $d$ is both cyclic and dualizing we write $a\perp c\Leftrightarrow ac\leq d\Leftrightarrow ca\leq d$ for $a\in Q,c\in C$ and $a^{\bot}=a\rightarrow d=d\leftarrow a=\bigvee\{c\in C\mid a\perp c\},c^{\bot}=% c\rightarrow d=d\leftarrow c=\bigvee\{a\in A\mid a\perp c\}$. A couple $C\stackrel{{\scriptstyle\phi}}{{\to}}Q$ is said to be: strong if $\phi$ is strong; unital if $Q$ is a unital quantale and $C$ is a unital $Q$-bimodule; Girard if it has a cyclic dualizing element.
2.2 Definition. A crossed cosimplicial group ${\mathcal{H}}$ is a sequence of groups $\{H^{n}\}_{n\geq 0}$ equipped with the following structure: (a) a small category $H\Delta$ such that the objects of $H\Delta$ are the ordinals $[n]=\{0,{,,\ldots,n}\}$, $n\geq 0$, (b) $H\Delta$ contains $\Delta$ as a subcategory, (c) $\operatorname{Aut}_{H\Delta}([n])=H^{n}$, $n\geq 0$, and (d) any morphism $f:[m]\to[n]$ in $H\Delta$ can be uniquely written as $h\circ\phi$, where $\phi\in\operatorname{Hom}_{\Delta}([m],[n])$ and $h\in H^{n}$.
4.4 Definition. A unital associative algebra $A$ is generic if the map $\omega_{A}:B\twoheadrightarrow B(A)$ is an isomorphism.
4.12 Definition. 2Multiplicative nonsymmetric operads were defined in [8]. A multiplicative operad is an operad ${\mathcal{O}}$ together with a morphism $p:\hbox{$U\hskip-2.0pt\it{\mathcal{A}}ss$}\to{\mathcal{O}}$, i.e. an operad under $U\hskip-2.0pt\it{\mathcal{A}}ss$. Equivalently, ${\mathcal{O}}$ has a distinguished ‘multiplication’ $\mu\in{\mathcal{O}}(2)$ and a ‘unit’ $e\in{\mathcal{O}}(0)$ such that $\mu\circ_{1}\mu=\mu\circ_{2}\mu\in{\mathcal{O}}(3)$ and $\mu\circ_{1}e=\mu\circ_{2}e={\it id}\in{\mathcal{O}}(1)$.
2.1 Definition. A crossed interval group ${\mathcal{H}}$ is a sequence of groups $\{H^{n}\}_{n\geq 0}$ equipped with the following structure: (a) a small category $\mathcal{I}H$ called the associated category such that the objects of $\mathcal{I}H$ are the ordinals ${\langle n\rangle}=\{-1,{0,\ldots,n},n+1\}$, $n\geq-1$, (b) $\mathcal{I}H$ contains $\mathcal{I}$ as a subcategory, (c) $\operatorname{Aut}_{\mathcal{I}H}({\langle n\rangle})={(H^{n+1})}^{{\rm op}}$, $n\geq-1$, and (d) any morphism $f:{\langle m\rangle}\to{\langle n\rangle}$ in $\mathcal{I}H$ can be uniquely written as $\phi\circ h$, where $\phi\in\operatorname{Hom}_{\mathcal{I}}({\langle m\rangle},{\langle n\rangle})$ and $h\in{(H^{m+1})}^{\rm op}$.
4.1 Definition. Let ${B}(A)^{l}_{{k_{1},\ldots,k_{n}}}$ denote, for $l,{k_{q},\ldots,k_{n}}\geq 0$, the abelian group of all natural, in the above sense, operations $O:C^{k_{1}}(A;A)\otimes\cdots\otimes C^{k_{n}}(A;A)\to C^{l}(A;A).$ The spaces ${B}(A)^{l}_{{k_{1},\ldots,k_{n}}}$ clearly form an ${\mathbb{N}}$-coloured suboperad ${B}(A)$ of the endomorphism operad of the ${\mathbb{N}}$-coloured collection $\{C^{n}(A;A)\}_{n\geq 0}$.
2.8 Definition. Let ${\mathcal{H}}$ be a crossed interval group and let ${\mathcal{C}}$ be a category. An ${\mathcal{H}}$-object in ${\mathcal{C}}$ is a functor $X:(\mathcal{I}H)^{{\rm op}}\rightarrow{\mathcal{C}}.$ A morphism between two ${\mathcal{H}}$-objects is a natural transformation of functors.
3.9 Definition. The miraculous map $m:\hbox{$\mathcal{N}$}(F_{\mathcal{S}}(C^{\bullet}))\to\hbox{$\mathcal{N}$}(C^% {\bullet})$ is defined by the formula $m(a,\sigma):={\rm sgn}(\sigma)a,\ a\in C^{q},\ \sigma\in S_{q},\ q\geq 0.$
4.8 Definition. Let ${\check{B}}^{l}_{k_{1},\ldots,k_{n}}$ be, for $l,{k_{1},\ldots,k_{n}}\geq 0$, the abelian group of families of linear maps $\alpha_{(V,M)}:\underline{V}(M^{\otimes k_{1}},M)\otimes\cdots\otimes% \underline{V}(M^{\otimes k_{n}},M)\rightarrow\underline{V}(M^{\otimes l},M)$ indexed by objects $(V,M)\in{\rm SymCat}_{\bullet}$ which are natural in the sense that, for any morphism $F:(V,M)\rightarrow(W,N)$, the diagram commutes. The spaces ${\check{B}}^{l}_{k_{1},\ldots,k_{n}}$ clearly assemble into a coloured operad ${\check{B}}$ in $\mathcal{A}b$ with natural numbers ${\mathbb{N}}=\{0,1,2,\ldots\}$ as its set of colors.
3.1 Definition. We say that $F:{\mathcal{D}}\to V$ as above is corepresented with models ${\mathfrak{M}}$ if there exists a (not necessarily $V$-enriched) transformation $\chi:{\widetilde{F}}\to F$ such that $\chi\lambda={\it id}_{F}$.
