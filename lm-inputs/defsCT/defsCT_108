3.5 Definition Let ${\cal C}$ be a strict pivotal category with left duality $X\mapsto(\overline{X},e_{X},d_{X})$ and monoidal natural isomorphism $(\alpha_{X}:X\rightarrow\overline{\overline{X}})_{X\in{\cal C}}$. For $X\in{\cal C}$ and $s\in\mathrm{End}\,X$, define the left and right traces of $s$ by $\displaystyle\mbox{tr}^{L}_{X}(s)$ $\displaystyle=$ $\displaystyle e_{X}\circ(\mathrm{id}_{\overline{X}}\otimes(s\circ\alpha^{-1}_{% X}))\circ d_{\overline{X}},$ $\displaystyle\mbox{tr}^{R}_{X}(s)$ $\displaystyle=$ $\displaystyle e_{\overline{X}}\circ((\alpha_{X}\circ s)\otimes\mathrm{id}_{% \overline{X}})\circ d_{X}.$ (Both traces take values in $\mathrm{End}\,{\bf 1}$.) The left and right dimensions of $X$ are defined by $d_{L/R}(X)=tr^{L/R}_{X}(\mathrm{id}_{X})$.
3.19 Definition Let ${\cal C}$ be a tensor category and ${\cal M}$ a category. A left, resp. right, ${\cal C}$-module structure on ${\cal M}$ is a tensor functor ${\cal C}\rightarrow\mathrm{End}\,{\cal M}$, resp. ${\cal C}^{{\mbox{\scriptsize rev}}}\rightarrow\mathrm{End}\,{\cal M}$. A left (right) ${\cal C}$-module category is a category ${\cal M}$ together with a left (right) ${\cal C}$-module structure. A module category is indecomposable if it is not the direct sum of two non-trivial module categories. Left (right) ${\cal C}$-module categories form a 2-category, whose 1-morphisms are functors between module categories intertwining the ${\cal C}$-actions and whose 2-morphisms are natural transformations between module functors.
Definition 2.4. Let $\mathcal{A}$ be a modular category over $\Bbbk$ with ${\mbox{\rm FSexp}}(\mathcal{A})=N$. (i) By virtue of Theorem II (i), a modular representation $\rho$ of $\mathcal{A}$ is said to be of level $n$ if $\operatorname{ord}(\rho(\mathfrak{t}))=n$. (ii) The projective modular representation $\overline{\rho}_{\mathcal{A}}$ of $\mathcal{A}$ factors through a projective representation $\overline{\rho}_{\mathcal{A},N}$ of $SL_{2}({\mathbb{Z}}_{N})$. We denote by $\kappa_{\mathcal{A}}$ the cohomology class in $H^{2}(SL_{2}({\mathbb{Z}}_{N}),\Bbbk^{\times})$ associated with $\overline{\rho}_{\mathcal{A},N}$.
Definition 6.2. Let $\mathcal{A}$ be a modular category over $\Bbbk$. (i) $\mathcal{A}$ is called weakly integral if its global dimension $\dim\mathcal{A}$ is an integer. (ii) $\mathcal{A}$ is called quasi-integral if $d(V)^{2}\in{\mathbb{Z}}$ for all simple objects $V\in\mathcal{A}$. (iii) $\mathcal{A}$ is called integral if $d(V)\in{\mathbb{Z}}$ for all $V\in\mathcal{A}$.
Definition 4.10. Let $U$ be a universe in $\mathbb{C}$. We say a pointwise weakly $\neg\neg$-stable unit is a map $u\colon 1\to U$ with the following property. In the internal logic of $\mathbb{E}$ we have that for every $c\in\mathcal{C}$ and every $x\in U(c)$, if $\neg\neg x=u(c)$ then $\mathrm{El}(c,x)$ has at most one element.
Definition 2.11. We say an object $X$ is discrete if one of the equivalent conditions in proposition 2.10 holds.
Definition 4.2. We say $\mathrm{El}\colon\tilde{U}\to U$ is a universe if the following hold. (1) Every isomorphism is $U$-small. (2) $U$-Small maps are closed under composition. (3) $U$-Small maps are closed under dependent product. (4) $U$-Small maps are closed under mapping path spaces. We say a universe $\mathrm{El}\colon\tilde{U}\to U$ is a homotopical universe if in addition to the above, we have the following. (1) $\mathrm{El}$ is a fibration (or equivalently every $U$-small map is a fibration). (2) $U$ is fibrant.
Definition 4.12. Let $V$ be a universe in $\mathbb{E}$. A homotopical Hofmann-Streicher universe on $V$ is a homotopical universe $U$ together with a map $i\colon U\to V_{\mathcal{C}}$ with the following property. Let $\chi\colon Y\to V_{\mathcal{C}}$ be any map. Then $\chi$ factors through $i$ if and only if the pullback of $\mathrm{El}$ along $\chi$ is a fibration.
Definition 2.13. Let $m\colon X\rightarrow Y$ be a monomorphism in a category $\mathbb{C}$. We say $m$ is $\neg\neg$-stable if the following statement holds in the internal language of $\mathbb{C}$. $\forall y\in Y,\;\neg\neg(\exists x\in X,m(x)=y)\,\rightarrow\,(\exists x\in X% ,m(x)=y)$ We say $m$ is $\neg\neg$-dense if the following statement holds in the internal language. $\forall y\in Y,\;\neg\neg(\exists x\in X,m(x)=y)$ We say an object $X$ is $\neg\neg$-separated if the diagonal map $X\to X\times X$ is $\neg\neg$-stable, or equivalently, if the following statement holds in the internal language. $\forall x,y\in X,\;\neg\neg(x=y)\,\rightarrow\,x=y$ Suppose $\mathbb{C}$ is a category of internal presheaves over an internal category $\mathcal{C}$ in a locally cartesian closed category $\mathbb{E}$. We say a monomorphism $m$ in $\mathbb{C}$ is pointwise $\neg\neg$-stable if the underlying map in $\mathbb{E}/\operatorname{Ob}(\mathcal{C})$ is $\neg\neg$-stable, or equivalently if the following statement holds in the internal language of $\mathbb{E}$: for every object $c$ of $\mathcal{C}$, $m_{c}$ is $\neg\neg$-stable. We similarly define pointwise $\neg\neg$-dense and pointwise $\neg\neg$-separated.
Definition 2.1. Suppose we are given a class of maps, whose elements we call cofibrations. (1) We say a map is a trivial fibration if it has the right lifting property against every cofibration. (2) We say a map is a fibration, if it has the right lifting property against $\delta_{0}\hat{\times}m$ and $\delta_{1}\hat{\times}m$ for every cofibration $m$. (3) We say an object $X$ is fibrant if the unique map $X\to 1$ is a fibration. (4) We say an object $X$ is cofibrant if the unique map $0\to X$ is a cofibration. (5) We say a map is a trivial cofibration if it has the left lifting property against every fibration.
Definition 4.5. We fix a map $u\colon 1\to U$ such that the following is a pullback, and refer to it as the unit type. $\xymatrix{1\ar[r]\ar[d]\save*!/dr-1.2pc/dr:(-1,1)@^{|-}\restore&\tilde{U}\ar[d% ]\\ 1\ar[r]_{u}&U}$ When $\mathbb{C}$ is a category of (possibly internal) presheaves over a category $\mathcal{C}$ we use the following notation. Since $u$ is a global section of the presheaf $U$, we can think of it as a choice of elements $u(c)$ for each object $c$ in the category $\mathcal{C}$.
Definition 6.1. Let $m\colon A\to B$ be a morphism of the syntactic category where $A$ and $B$ are singleton2The singleton condition is to make the proofs a little easier but can be omitted with a bit more work. contexts. We say $m$ is a partially split monomorphism if there is a raw term $t(y)$ whose only free variable is $y$ such that for any context $\Gamma$ and any term $\Gamma\vdash a:A$, we have $\Gamma\vdash t(m(a)):A$ and $\Gamma\vdash t(m(a))\equiv a:A$.
Definition 4.3. We say a homotopical universe $\mathrm{El}\colon\tilde{U}\to U$ is univalent if the first projection $\Sigma_{X:U}\Sigma_{Y:U}\operatorname{Equiv}(X,Y)\to U$ is a trivial fibration.
Definition 2.3. We say path types are identity types if for every fibrant object $X$, the map $r^{X}$ is a cofibration.
Definition 4.11. If $\mathbb{E}$ has a universe $V$, recall that we can define the Hofmann-Streicher universe $V_{\mathcal{C}}$ in $\mathbb{C}$ as follows. Given an object $c$ of $\mathcal{C}$, we think of $(V_{\mathcal{C}})_{c}$ as being the collection of “small presheaves” on the category $\int_{c}\mathbf{y}c$, as defined by Hofmann and Streicher in [10]. The action of morphisms is defined via composition. Defining this internally in $\mathbb{E}$ takes a little care, but this has been done by Uemura in [24, Section 4.1].
Definition 2.2. Given any object $X$, we define the path object on $X$ to be the object $X^{\mathbb{I}}$ together with the maps $r^{X}$, $p^{X}_{0}$ and $p^{X}_{1}$, where $r^{X}\colon X\to X^{\mathbb{I}}$ is the constant map, and $p_{0}^{X},p_{1}^{X}\colon X^{\mathbb{I}}\to X^{1}\cong X$ are given by composition with $\delta_{0}$ and $\delta_{1}$ respectively.
Definition 4.7. Let $V$ be a universe in $\mathbb{E}$. A weakly $\neg\neg$-stable unit is a map $z\colon 1\to V$ such that the following holds in the internal logic of $\mathbb{E}$. (1) $\mathrm{El}(z)$ has exactly one element. (2) For all $x\in V$, if $\neg\neg(x=z)$, then $\mathrm{El}(x)$ has at most one element.
Definition 5.1. The lesser limited principle of omniscience ($\mathbf{LLPO}$) states that if $\alpha\colon\mathbb{N}\to 2$ is a binary sequence such that $\alpha(n)=1$ for at most one $n$, then either $\alpha(2n)=0$ for all $n$, or $\alpha(2n+1)=0$ for all $n$.
Definition 4.1. Suppose we are given a map $\mathrm{El}\colon\tilde{U}\to U$. We say a map is $U$-small if it is a pullback of $\mathrm{El}$.
Definition 4.4 Given a pseudo quotient vector bundle $\mathcal{A}=(X,A,\kappa)\in\varPsi\textit{QVBun}^{1*}_{\mathcal{T}}$ we call corestriction map of $\mathcal{A}$ to the map $\gamma^{\complement}\colon\operatorname{\mathfrak{C}}X\to\operatorname{Max}A$ left adjoint to $\sigma^{\complement}$. We represent the restriction of $\gamma^{\complement}$ to $\mathfrak{I}\operatorname{\mathfrak{C}}X$ by $\mathfrak{k}^{\complement}$ and we represent by $\boldsymbol{\operatorname{\mathfrak{C}}}\mathcal{A}$ the pseudo linearized colocale $\boldsymbol{\operatorname{\mathfrak{C}}}\mathcal{A}=(\mathfrak{I}\operatorname% {\mathfrak{C}}X,A,\gamma^{\complement})$.
Definition 2. Let $S,T$ be objects of $\mathcal{C}$. The identity lens $\mathrm{id}_{\binom{S}{T}}:\binom{S}{T}\to\binom{S}{T}$ is given by $v_{\mathrm{id}_{\binom{S}{T}}}=\mathrm{id}_{S}$ and $u_{\mathrm{id}_{\binom{S}{T}}}=\pi_{2}:S\times T\to T$.
Definition 1. Let $S,T,A,B$ be objects of $\mathcal{C}$. A bimorphic lens $\lambda:\binom{S}{T}\to\binom{A}{B}$ over $\mathcal{C}$ consists of a view morphism $v_{\lambda}:S\to A$ and an update morhism $u_{\lambda}:S\times B\to T$ in $\mathcal{C}$.
Definition 3. Let $\lambda:\binom{S}{T}\to\binom{A}{B}$ and $\mu:\binom{A}{B}\to\binom{P}{Q}$ be lenses over $\mathcal{C}$. The composition $\mu\circ\lambda:\binom{S}{T}\to\binom{P}{Q}$ is given by $v_{\mu\circ\lambda}=v_{\mu}\circ v_{\lambda}$ and $u_{\mu\circ\lambda}:S\times Q\xrightarrow{\Delta_{S}\times Q}S\times S\times Q% \xrightarrow{S\times v_{\lambda}\times Q}S\times A\times Q\xrightarrow{S\times u% _{\mu}}S\times B\overset{u_{\mu}}{\longrightarrow}T$
Definition 2.1. ([11]) A Boolean contact algebra, or, simply, contact algebra (abbreviated as CA), is a structure $(B,C)$, where $B$ is a Boolean algebra, and $C$ a binary relation on $B$, called a contact relation, which satisfies the following axioms: $(C1)$. If $a\not=0$ then $aCa$. $(C2)$. If $aCb$ then $a\not=0$ and $b\not=0$. $(C3)$. $aCb$ implies $bCa$. $(C4)$. $aC(b\vee c)$ if and only if $aCb$ or $aCc$. Two contact algebras $(B,C)$ and $(B^{\prime},C^{\prime})$ are said to be isomorphic if there exists a CA-isomorphism between them, i.e., a Boolean isomorphism $\varphi:B\longrightarrow B^{\prime}$ such that, for all $a,b\in B$, $aCb$ if and only if $\varphi(a)C^{\prime}\varphi(b)$. With $-C$ denoting the set complement of $C$ in $B\times B$, we shall consider two more properties of contact algebras: $(C5)$. If $a(-C)b$ then $a(-C)c$ and $b(-C)c^{*}$ for some $c\in B$. $(C6)$. If $a\not=1$ then there exists $b\not=0$ such that $b(-C)a$. A contact algebra $(B,C)$ is called a Boolean normal contact algebra or, briefly, normal contact algebra (abbreviated as NCA) [7, 15] if it satisfies $(C5)$ and $(C6)$. (Note that if $0\neq 1$, then $(C2)$ follows from the axioms $(C4)$, $(C3)$, and $(C6)$.)
Definition 2.5. ([11]) For a contact algebra $(B,C)$ one defines the relation $R_{(B,C)}$ on the set of all filters on $B$ by $f\,R_{(B,C)}\,gifandonlyif\ f\times g\subseteq C,$ for all filters $f,g$ on $B$.
Definition 2.7. A non–empty subset $\sigma$ of a CA $(B,C)$ is called a cluster if for all $x,y\in B$, (CL1). If $x,y\in\sigma$ then $xCy$;. (CL2). If $x\vee y\in\sigma$ then $x\in\sigma$ or $y\in\sigma$. (CL3). If $xCy$ for every $y\in\sigma$, then $x\in\sigma$.
Definition 2.2. For a contact algebra $(B,C)$ we define a binary relation $\ll_{C}$ on $B$, called non-tangential inclusion, by $\displaystyle\ a\ll_{C}b\text{ if and only if \ }a(-C)b^{*}.$ If $C$ is understood, we shall simply write $\ll$ instead of $\ll_{C}$.

Definition 1.2 (adjoint). A functor $f$: G$\rightarrow$ H is said to be adjoint if for every H-object $H$ there exists a $f$-universal arrow with domain $H$. Consequently, there exists unique natural transformation (called the unit) $\eta_{H}:id_{H}\rightarrow ff_{1}$, where $id_{H}$ is an identity morphism from $H$ to $H$ and $f_{1}:H\rightarrow G$ is a functor, is a $f$-universal arrow. Diagram of unit is shown in Fig.2)

Where $f^{-1}(v)=v\circ f$, $v\in Cont(S_{2},\alpha_{2})$.
Definition 1.3 (coadjoint). A functor $f$: G$\rightarrow$ H is said to be co-adjoint if for every H-object $H$ there exists a $f$-couniversal arrow with codomain $H$. As a result, there exists a natural transformation $\xi_{G}:f_{1}\circ f(G)\rightarrow id_{G}(G)$, where $id_{G}$ is an identity morphism from $G$ to $G$, and $f_{1}:H\rightarrow G$ is a functor such that for a given morphism $g:f(H)\rightarrow G$, there is a unique H-morphism $\tilde{g}:H\rightarrow f(G)$ such that the triangle (see Fig.3) commutes, in otherwords $g=f_{1}(\tilde{g})\circ\xi_{G}$ .
