Definition 1.2. A semigroup $S$ is said to be inverse if every element $x\in S$ has a unique inverse, i.e., an element $x^{\prime}\in S$ such that $xx^{\prime}x=x$ and $x^{\prime}xx^{\prime}=x^{\prime}$.
Definition 2.2. Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a category with subobjects. Then a morphism $f$ in $\mathcal{C}$ is said to have a normal factorisation if $f=quj$, where $q$ is a retraction, $u$ is an isomorphism and $j$ is an inclusion, respectively in $\mathcal{C}$.
Definition 2.7. Let $\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathcal{D}$ be unambiguous categories. A cross-connection between $\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathcal{D}$ is a quadruplet $(\mathcal{C},\mathcal{D};{\Gamma},\Delta)$ where $\Gamma\colon\mathcal{D}\to\mathcal{C}^{*}$ and $\Delta\colon\mathcal{C}\to\mathcal{D}^{*}$ are local isomorphisms such that for $c\in v\mathcal{C}$ and $d\in v\mathcal{D}$ $c\in M\Gamma(d)\iff d\in M\Delta(c).$
Definition 2.1. Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a small category and $\mathcal{P}$ be a subcategory of $\mathcal{C}$. Then the pair $(\mathcal{C},\mathcal{P})$ (often denoted by just $\mathcal{C}$) is said to be a category with subobjects if: (1) $\mathcal{P}$ is a strict preorder with $v\mathcal{P}=v\mathcal{C}$. (2) Every $f\in\mathcal{P}$ is a monomorphism in $\mathcal{C}$. (3) If $f,g\in\mathcal{P}$ and if $f=hg$ for some $h\in\mathcal{C}$, then $h\in\mathcal{P}$.
Definition 2.4. A category $\mathcal{C}$ is said to be an unambiguous category if: (UC 1) $\mathcal{C}$ is a category with subobjects; (UC 2) every inclusion in $\mathcal{C}$ splits uniquely; (UC 3) every morphism in $\mathcal{C}$ admits a unique normal factorisation; (UC 4) for each $c\in v\mathcal{C}$ there exists a normal cone $\mu$ such that $\mu(c)=1_{c}$.
Definition 3.2. Let $\mathcal{C}$ be an so-category in which inclusions split uniquely. Then an arbitrary morphism $f=j(c_{1},c_{2})q(c_{2},c_{3})j(c_{3},c_{4})\cdots q(c_{n-1},c_{n})$ in $\langle\mathcal{C}\rangle$ is said to have an inversive factorisation if $f=q(c_{1},d)j(d,c_{n})$ where $d=\bigwedge\limits_{i=1}^{n}c_{i}$, $q$ is the retraction from $c_{1}$ to $d$ and $j$ is the inclusion from $d$ to $c_{n}$.
Definition 2.4. Let $X$ be an object in a model category $\mathcal{C}$. (1) A cylinder object for $X$ is an object $X\otimes I$ together with a factorization $X\coprod X\xrightarrow{i}X\otimes I\xrightarrow{p}X$ of the canonical folding map $X\coprod X\to X$ into a cofibration followed by an acyclic fibration. Two maps $f,g:X\to Y$ in $\mathcal{C}$ are said to be left homotopic if their sum $f\coprod g:X\coprod X\to Y$ extends to a map $X\otimes I\to Y$. (2) A path object for $X$ is an object $X^{I}$ together with a factorization $X\xrightarrow{i}X^{I}\xrightarrow{p}X\times X$ of the canonical diagonal map $X\to X\times X$ into an acyclic cofibration followed by a fibration. Two maps $f,g:X\to Y$ in $\mathcal{C}$ are said to be right homotopic if the product map $(f,g):X\to Y\times Y$ lifts to a map $X\to Y^{I}$.
Definition 5.7. Let $A\in\operatorname{pcCDGA_{loc}}$ and set $\operatorname{Harr}(A)$ to be the dg Lie algebra whose underlying space is the free Lie algebra on $\Sigma^{-1}I(A)^{*}$ and the differential $d$ is defined as $d=d_{I}+d_{II}$; here $d_{I}$ is induced by the internal differential on $I(A)$ and $d_{II}$ is determined by its restriction onto $\Sigma^{-1}I(A)^{*}$ which is in turn induced by the product map $I(A)\otimes I(A)\to I(A)$.
Definition 2.7. The homotopy category of a model category $\mathcal{C}$ is the category $\operatorname{ho}\mathcal{C}$ whose objects are the objects in $\mathcal{C}$ that are both fibrant and cofibrant and for two fibrant-cofibrant objects $X,Y\in\mathcal{C}$ we have $\operatorname{Hom}_{\operatorname{ho}\mathcal{C}}(X,Y):=[X,Y]$, the homotopy classes of maps from $X$ to $Y$.
Definition 2.12. A Quillen adjunction $F:\mathcal{C}\rightleftarrows\mathcal{D}:G$ is called a Quillen equivalence if the corresponding adjunction $LF:\operatorname{ho}\mathcal{C}\rightleftarrows\operatorname{ho}\mathcal{D}:RG$ is an ordinary equivalence.
Definition 4.7. Let $\mathfrak{g}$ is a non-unital dg algebra over a field $k$ of arbitrary characteristic. An element $x\in\mathfrak{g}$ is called an MC element if it satisfies $d(x)+x^{2}=0$. The set of all MC elements in $\mathfrak{g}$ will be denoted by $\operatorname{MC}(\mathfrak{g})$.
Definition 5.21. A morphism $f:A\to B$ in $\operatorname{pcDGA_{loc}}$ is called (1) a weak equivalence if $\operatorname{Cobar}(f):\operatorname{Cobar}(B)\to\operatorname{Cobar}(A)$ is a quasi-isomorphism of dg algebras; (2) a fibration if $f$ is surjective; (3) a cofibration if $f$ has the LLP with respect to all acyclic fibrations.
Definition 4.3. Given a pro-nilpotent dg Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ we define its MC moduli set $\mathscr{MC}(\mathfrak{g})$ as the set of equivalence classes $\operatorname{MC}(\mathfrak{g})/{\sim}$ under gauge equivalence.
Definition 5.11. A morphism $f:A\to B$ in $\operatorname{pcCDGA_{loc}}$ is called (1) a weak equivalence if $\operatorname{Harr}(f):\operatorname{Harr}(B)\to\operatorname{Harr}(A)$ is a quasi-isomorphism of dg Lie algebras; (2) a fibration if $f$ is surjective; (3) a cofibration if $f$ has the LLP with respect to all acyclic fibrations.
Definition 2.16. A model category $\mathcal{C}$ is called left proper if for any pushout diagram in $\mathcal{C}$ $\xymatrix{A\ar^{i}[r]\ar_{f}[d]&B\ar^{g}[d]\\ C\ar[r]&D}$ for which $i$ is a cofibration and $f$ is a weak equivalence, then the map $g$ is also a weak equivalence. Dually, $\mathcal{C}$ is right proper if for any pullback diagram in $\mathcal{C}$ $\xymatrix{A\ar[r]\ar_{f}[d]&B\ar^{g}[d]\\ C\ar_{p}[r]&D}$ for which $p$ is a fibration and $g$ is a weak equivalence, then the map $f$ is also a weak equivalence.
Definition 4.10. Let $\mathfrak{g}$ be a non-unital dg algebra. Then two MC elements $x,y\in\mathfrak{g}$ are homotopic if there exists $z\in\operatorname{MC}(\mathfrak{g}\otimes\mathcal{I})$ such that $(1\otimes p_{1})(z)=x$ and $(1\otimes p_{2})(z)=y$.
Definition 2.1. A category $\mathcal{C}$ is a model category if it is supplied with three classes of morphisms: weak equivalences $\mathbf{W}$, fibrations $\mathbf{F}$ and cofibrations $\mathbf{C}$, each closed under compositions and containing identity maps. Morphisms in $\mathbf{C}\cap\mathbf{W}$ are called acyclic cofibrations and morphisms in $\mathbf{F}\cap\mathbf{W}$ are similarly called acyclic fibrations. The following axioms are required to hold. (MC1) $\mathcal{C}$ contains arbitrary limits and colimits; (MC2) If $f,g$ are morphisms in $\mathcal{C}$ for which $f\circ g$ is defined and out of three morphisms $f,g,f\circ g$ two are weak equivalences, then so is the third. (MC3) The classes of morphisms $\mathbf{W}$, $\mathbf{C}$ and $\mathbf{F}$ are each closed under retracts. (MC4) Given a diagram in $\mathcal{C}$ of the form $\xymatrix{A\ar_{i}[d]\ar[r]&X\ar^{p}[d]\\ B\ar[r]\ar@{-->}[ur]&Y}$ the dotted arrow making the whole diagram commutative exists if either (a) $i\in\mathbf{C}\cap\mathbf{W}$ and $p\in\mathbf{F}$ or (b) $i\in\mathbf{C}$ and $p\in\mathbf{F}\cap\mathbf{W}$. If the dotted arrow in (2.1) exists, we say that $i$ has the Left Lifting Property (LLP) with respect to $p$ and $p$ has the Right Lifting Property (RLP) with respect to $i$. (MC5) Any morphism $f$ in $\mathcal{C}$ can functorially be factored in two ways: (a) as $f=p\circ i$ where $p\in\mathbf{F}$ and $i\in\mathbf{C}\cap\mathbf{W}$ or (b) as $f=p\circ i$ where $p\in\mathbf{F}\cap\mathbf{W}$ and $i\in\mathbf{C}$.
Definition 5.1. A pseudocompact vector space is a topological vector space that is complete and whose fundamental system of neighbourhoods of zero is formed by subspaces of finite codimension. Morphisms of pseudocompact vector spaces are assumed to be continuous. A graded pseudocompact vector space is a graded object in the category of pseudocompact vector spaces, i.e. a sequence $V^{i}$, $i\in\mathbb{Z}$ where each $V^{i}$ is a pseudocompact vector space with morphisms defined component-wise. Finally, a dg pseudocompact vector space is a graded pseudocompact vector space $V^{i}$, $i\in\mathbb{Z}$ with a continuous differential.
Definition 3.1. Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a closed model category. We say that $\mathcal{C}$ is compactly generated if there exists a set $S$ of compact cofibrant objects in $\mathcal{C}$ that detect weak equivalences, i.e. a map $X\to Y$ in $\mathcal{C}$ is a weak equivalence if and only if for any $K\in S$ there is a bijection $[K,X]\to[K,Y]$.
Definition 5.17. For $A\in\operatorname{pcDGA_{loc}}$ set $\operatorname{Cobar}(A)=T\Sigma^{-1}I(A)^{*}$, the uncompleted tensor algebra on the discrete vector space $\Sigma^{-1}I(A)^{*}$. The differential $d$ on $\operatorname{Cobar}(A)$ is defined as $d=d_{I}+d_{II}$; here $d_{I}$ is induced by the internal differential on $I(A)$ and $d_{II}$ is determined by its restriction onto $\Sigma^{-1}I(A)^{*}$ which is in turn induced by the product map $I(A)\otimes I(A)\to I(A)$.
Definition 2.10. Let $\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathcal{D}$ be model categories and $F:\mathcal{C}\rightleftarrows\mathcal{D}:G$ be an adjoint pair of functors so that $F$ is left adjoint to $G$. We say that $(F,G)$ is a Quillen adjunction if $F$ takes cofibrations in $\mathcal{C}$ to cofibrations in $\mathcal{D}$ and $G$ takes fibrations in $\mathcal{D}$ to fibrations in $\mathcal{C}$. We will refer to $F$ as a left Quillen functor and to $G$ as a right Quillen functor.
Definition 4.4. Let $\mathfrak{g}$ be a nilpotent dg Lie algebra. Two MC elements $x,y\in\mathfrak{g}$ are called Sullivan homotopic if there exists $z\in\operatorname{MC}(\mathfrak{g}[t,dt])$ such that $z|_{t=0}=x$ and $z|_{t=1}=y$.
Definition 5.18. For $\mathfrak{g}\in\operatorname{DGA/k}$ set $\operatorname{Bar}(\mathfrak{g})=\hat{T}\Sigma^{-1}\mathfrak{I}(\mathfrak{g})^% {*}$, the completed tensor algebra on $\Sigma^{-1}\mathfrak{I}(\mathfrak{g})^{*}$. The differential $d$ on $\operatorname{Bar}(\mathfrak{g})$ is defined as $d=d_{I}+d_{II}$; here $d_{I}$ is induced by the internal differential on $\mathfrak{g}$ and $d_{II}$ is determined by its restriction onto $\Sigma^{-1}\mathfrak{I}(\mathfrak{g})^{*}$ which is in turn induced by the product map $\mathfrak{I}(\mathfrak{g})\otimes\mathfrak{I}(\mathfrak{g})\to\mathfrak{I}(% \mathfrak{g})$.
Definition 4.1. Let $\mathfrak{g}$ be a dg Lie algebra over a field $k$ of characteristic zero. An element $x\in\mathfrak{g}^{1}$ is called an MC element if it satisfies the following equation (called the MC or master equation) $d(x)+\frac{1}{2}[x,x]=0.$ The set of MC elements in $\mathfrak{g}$ will be denoted by $\operatorname{MC}(\mathfrak{g})$. If $A$ is a commutative dg algebra then $\mathfrak{g}\otimes A$ has naturally the structure of a dg Lie algebra and we will write $\operatorname{MC}(\mathfrak{g},A)$ for $\operatorname{MC}(\mathfrak{g}\otimes A)$.
Definition 5.9. For a dg Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ set $\operatorname{CE}(\mathfrak{g})=\hat{S}\Sigma^{-1}\mathfrak{g}^{*}$, the completed symmetric algebra on $\Sigma^{-1}\mathfrak{g}^{*}$. The differential $d$ on $\operatorname{CE}(\mathfrak{g})$ is defined as $d=d_{I}+d_{II}$; here $d_{I}$ is induced by the internal differential on $\mathfrak{g}$ and $d_{II}$ is determined by its restriction onto $\Sigma^{-1}\mathfrak{g}^{*}$ which is in turn induced by the bracket map $\mathfrak{g}\otimes\mathfrak{g}\to\mathfrak{g}$.
Definition 2.14. Let $X,Y$ and $Z$ be objects in a closed model category $\mathcal{C}$ supplied with maps $X\to Y$ and $X\to Z$. Factor the map $LX\to X\to Y$ as $LX\xrightarrow{i_{1}}\tilde{Y}\xrightarrow{p_{1}}Y$ where $i_{1}$ is a cofibration and $p_{1}$ is an acyclic fibration; similarly factor the map $LX\to X\to Z$ as $LX\xrightarrow{i_{2}}\tilde{Z}\xrightarrow{p_{2}}Z$ where $i_{2}$ is a cofibration and $p_{2}$ is an acyclic fibration. Then the homotopy pushout $Y\coprod^{h}_{X}Z$ is by definition $\tilde{Y}\coprod_{LX}\tilde{Z}$. A homotopy pullback is defined dually as a homotopy pushout in $\mathcal{C}^{op}$. It will be denoted for objects $X,Y$ and $Z$ by $Y\times^{h}_{X}Z$.
Definition 4.9. The MC moduli set $\mathscr{MC}(\mathfrak{g})$ is the set of equivalence classes $\operatorname{MC}(\mathfrak{g})/{\sim}$ under gauge equivalence. As before, if $A$ is another dg algebra then we write $\operatorname{MC}(\mathfrak{g},A)$ for $\operatorname{MC}(\mathfrak{g}\otimes A)$, and write $\mathscr{MC}(\mathfrak{g},A)$ for $\mathscr{MC}(\mathfrak{g}\otimes A)$.
Definition 4. A ($\omega$-continuous) valuation on a set $A$ is an $\omega$-continuous map $\mu:\mathcal{O}(A)\rightarrow\mathbb{R}_{l}^{+}$ preserving the bottom element that satisfies the modularity law $\mu(U)+\mu(V)=\mu(U\cup V)+\mu(U\cap V).$ for all opens $U,V\in\mathcal{O}(A)$. $\mu$ is a sub-probability valuation if $\mu(A)\leq 1$. The set of all valuations on $A$ is denoted by $\mathfrak{V}(A)$ and the set of sub-probability valuations by $\mathfrak{V}_{\leq 1}(A)$.
Definition 8. Let $A$ and $B$ be sets. For $U\in\mathcal{O}(A)$ and $V\in\mathcal{O}(B)$, let $U\times V=\{(a,b)\in A\times B\mid a\in U\land b\in V\}\in\mathcal{O}(A,B);$ it is open because $\mathbb{S}$ is closed under binary meets. $A\times B$ has the product topology if $\mathcal{O}(A)\subseteq\mathcal{P}(A)$ is the least subset containing the sets $U\times V$ for all $U\subseteq A$ and $V\subseteq B$ open that is closed under enumerable joins.
Definition 10. The cover relation on $L$ is generated by $(a,b)\triangleleft\bigg{\{}\bigcup_{j=1}^{n}\,(a^{\prime}_{j},b^{\prime}_{j})% \mid n\geq 0\text{ and }a<a^{\prime}_{j},b^{\prime}_{j}<b\text{ for }j\leq n% \bigg{\}}$ for $a<b$ under binary unions.
Definition 1. An $\omega$-cpo presentation consists of a preorder $P$ and a cover relation $\triangleleft\subseteq P\times\mathcal{P}(P)$ such that $p\triangleleft U$ ($a$ is covered by $U$) holds only if $U$ is an enumerable directed suborder of $P$ (thus $U$ is given by a map $\mathbb{N}\rightarrow P$ with directed image). We generally leave the covering relation $\triangleleft$ implicit and refer to the $\omega$-cpo presentation $(P,\triangleleft)$ as just $P$. A morphism of $\omega$-cpo presentations $f:P\rightarrow Q$ is a monotone map preserving covers, in the sense that if $p\triangleleft U$ holds in $P$, then $f(a)\triangleleft f(U)$ holds in $Q$ for all $a\in P$ and $U\subseteq P$. Every $\omega$-cpo $C$ can be regarded as an $\omega$-cpo presentation with cover relation $c\triangleleft U\iff c\leq\bigvee U$ for $U\subseteq C$ directed and enumerable. $\omega$-continuous maps $C\rightarrow D$ of $\omega$-cpos may be identified with their morphisms when considered as $\omega$-cpo presentations.
Definition 6. Let $f:A\rightarrow\mathbb{R}_{l}^{+}$. The lower $\mu$-integral $\int f\,d\mu\in\mathbb{R}_{l}^{+}$ is defined as follows. For $q\in\mathbb{Q}_{+}$ let $[f>q]=\{x\in A\mid q<f(x)\};$ it is an open subset of $A$. Let $s_{f,m,n}=\sum_{i=1}^{mn}\frac{1}{m}\mu([f>\frac{i}{m}])$ for $m,n\in\mathbb{N}$. Now $\int fd\mu=\bigvee_{n,m\in\mathbb{N}}s_{f,m,n}.$
Definition 2. A subset $S\subseteq\Omega$ is a dominance if for all $p\in\Omega$ and $s\in S$ it holds that $(s\implies(p\in S))\implies(s\land p)\in S.$
Definition 5. A lower integral on $A$ is an $\omega$-continuous map $\mathcal{I}:(\mathbb{R}_{l}^{+})^{A}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}_{l}^{+}$ preserving the bottom element that is furthermore additive, i.e. satisfies $\mathcal{I}(f+g)=\mathcal{I}(f)+\mathcal{I}(g).$ for all $f,g:A\rightarrow\mathbb{R}_{l}^{+}$. $\mathcal{I}$ is a sub-probability lower integral if $\mathcal{I}(\mathds{1}_{A})\leq 1$. The set of all lower integrals on $A$ is denoted by $\mathfrak{G}(A)$ and the set of sub-probability lower integrals by $\mathfrak{G}_{\leq 1}(A)$.
Definition 9. The partial order $L$ is the least suborder of $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{Q})$ containing the sets $(a,b)=\{x\in\mathbb{Q}\mid a<q<b\}$ for all $a\leq b\in\mathbb{Q}$ that is closed under binary unions.
Definition 3. A lower real is an open subset $L:\mathbb{Q}\rightarrow\mathbb{S}$ of $\mathbb{Q}$ satisfying the following axioms: • There merely exists $q\in\mathbb{Q}$ such that $L(q)$, • for all $q\in\mathbb{Q}$, if $L(q)$ then there merely exists $q^{\prime}>q$ such that $L(q^{\prime})$, and • for all $q<q^{\prime}\in\mathbb{Q}$, if $L(q^{\prime})$, then $L(q)$. The set of all lower reals is denoted by $\mathbb{R}_{l}$. For $q\in\mathbb{Q}$ let $\underline{q}=\{p\in\mathbb{Q}\mid p<q\}\in\mathbb{R}_{l}.$ The subset of non-negative lower reals is given by $\mathbb{R}_{l}^{+}=\{L\in\mathbb{R}_{l}\mid\forall q\in\mathbb{Q}(q<0\implies L% (q))\}.$
Definition 11. The $\sigma$-frame of formal real opens $\mathcal{O}(\mathbb{R}_{F})$ is given by the $\omega$-cpo completion of $L$ with respect to the covers of definition 10.
Definition 7. Let $L$ be a distributive lattice with bottom element. The modular monoid $M(L)$ is the commutative monoid generated by the carrier of $L$ subject to $a+b=(a\wedge b)+(a\vee b)$ for all $a,b\in L$, and $0=\bot$.
Definition 11. Objects of $\mathbf{BDLatD}$ are pairs $(L,\mathbf{D}_{L})$ with $L=(L,\vee,\wedge,0,1)$ a bounded distributive lattice and $\mathbf{D}_{L}\subseteq\mathcal{PF}(L)$ such that the following condition is satisfied: $(DPF)\qquad\qquad\qquad\forall a,b\in L\quad a\neq b\implies\tilde{a}^{d}\neq% \tilde{b}^{d},\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad$ where $\tilde{a}^{d}=\{\mathcal{F}\in\mathbf{D}_{L}:a\in\mathcal{F}\}$. Then $\mathbf{D}_{L}$ is called a decent set of prime filters on $L$. Morphisms of $\mathbf{BDLatD}$ are such homomorphisms of bounded lattices $h:L\to M$ that for each $\mathcal{G}\in\mathbf{D}_{M}$ the preimage filter $h^{\bullet}(\mathcal{G})=\{a\in L:h(a)\in\mathcal{G}\}$ belongs to $\mathbf{D}_{L}$, shortly: $h^{\bullet}(\mathbf{D}_{M})\subseteq\mathbf{D}_{L}$.
Definition 3 ([10], Definition 2.9). If $(X,\mathcal{L}_{X})$ is a small space, then the topology $\mathcal{L}_{X}^{wo}=\tau(\mathcal{L}_{X}),\mbox{ generated by $\mathcal{L}_{X% }$ in $\mathcal{P}(X)$,}$ is called the family of weakly open sets in $(X,\mathcal{L}_{X})$.
Definition 1 ([10], Definition 2.21). A small space is a pair $(X,\mathcal{L}_{X})$, where $X$ is any set and $\mathcal{L}_{X}$ is a bounded sublattice of the powerset $\mathcal{P}(X)$. This means $\mathcal{L}_{X}$ satisfies the conditions: (a) $\emptyset,X\in\mathcal{L}_{X}$, (b) if $L,M\in\mathcal{L}_{X}$, then $L\cap M,L\cup M\in\mathcal{L}_{X}$. Elements of $\mathcal{L}_{X}$ are called smops (i.e., small open sets) or just open sets in $X$. If $(X,\mathcal{L}_{X})$ and $(Y,\mathcal{L}_{Y})$ are small spaces, then a mapping $f:X\to Y$ is continuous (or bounded continuous or strictly continuous) if $f^{-1}(\mathcal{L}_{Y})\subseteq\mathcal{L}_{X}$ (compare [10], Definition 2.40). The category of small spaces and their continuous mappings is denoted by SS.
Definition 16. A topological space $(Y,\tau_{Y})$ will be called a spectralification of a topological space $(X,\tau_{X})$ if: (1) $(Y,\tau_{Y})$ is a spectral space, (2) there exists a topological embedding $e:(X,\tau_{X})\to(Y,\tau_{Y})$, (3) $e(X)$ is dense in $(Y,\tau_{Y})$.
Definition 7. An object of $\mathbf{SpecD}$ is a pair $((X,\tau_{X}),X_{d})$ where $(X,\tau_{X})$ is a spectral space and $X_{d}$ is a subset of $X$ (called a decent subset) such that the following condition is satisfied: $(DS)\qquad\qquad\forall\>U,V\in CO(X)\quad U\neq V\implies U\cap X_{d}\neq V% \cap X_{d}.$ A morphism of $\mathbf{SpecD}$ is a spectral mapping $g:X\to Y$ between spectral spaces $(X,\tau_{X})$ and $(Y,\tau_{Y})$ that respects decent subsets, that is: $g(X_{d})\subseteq Y_{d}$.
Definition 2. A small space $(X,\mathcal{L}_{X})$ will be called $T_{0}$ (or Kolgomorov) if the family $\mathcal{L}_{X}$ separates points ([4], Remainder 1.1.4), which means that for $x,y\in X$: $\mbox{ if }x\in L\iff y\in L\mbox{ for each }L\in\mathcal{L}_{X},\mbox{ then }% x=y.$ We get a full subcategory $\mathbf{SS}_{0}$ of Kolgomorov small spaces in SS.
Definition 13. [4] Let $\mathbb{D}$ and $\mathbb{J}$ be two classes of filters and $\mathbb{D}_{*}$ and $\mathbb{J}_{*}$ the corresponding families of dual ideals. We say that $\mathcal{A}$ is cover-$\nicefrac{{\mathbb{J}_{*}}}{{\mathbb{D}_{*}}}$-compact at $\mathcal{B}$ (for a convergence $\xi$) if for every $\xi$-cover $\mathcal{C}\in\mathbb{J}_{*}$ of $\mathcal{B}$, there is $\mathcal{S}\subset\mathcal{C}$ with $\operatorname{S}\in\mathbb{D}_{*}$ such that $\mathcal{S}$ is a $\xi$-cover of $\mathcal{A}$, equivalently, $\forall\mathcal{G}\in\mathbb{J}\;\mathrm{\mathrm{adh}}_{\xi}\mathcal{G}\neg\#% \mathcal{B}\Longrightarrow\exists\mathcal{D}\in\mathbb{D},\mathcal{D}\leq% \mathcal{G}:\mathrm{\mathrm{adh}}_{\xi}\mathcal{D}\neg\#\mathcal{A},$ equivalently $\forall\mathcal{G}\in\mathbb{J}\left(\forall\mathcal{D}\in\mathbb{D},\mathcal{% D}\leq\mathcal{G}\;\mathrm{\mathrm{adh}}_{\xi}\mathcal{D}\in\mathcal{A}^{\#}% \Longrightarrow\mathrm{\mathrm{adh}}_{\xi}\mathcal{G}\in\mathcal{B}^{\#}\right).$
Definition \thedfn. Let $\mathcal{O}(X)$ denote the collection of all non-empty open subsets of a topological space $X$. We call $P\subseteq\mathcal{O}(X)$ a concrete local bi-pseudobasis of $X$ if $\displaystyle\text{Every $O\in P$ is a Hausdorff subspace of $X$}.$ $\displaystyle\text{Every $x\in X$ is contained in some $O\in P$}.$ $\displaystyle\text{The neighborhoods in $P$ of any fixed $x\in X$ form a $% \Subset$-filter}.$ $\displaystyle\text{Every $O\in\mathcal{O}(X)$ contains some $N\in P$}.$ $\displaystyle\text{The subsets in $P$ distinguish the points of $X$}.$
Definition \thedfn. We call $T\subseteq P$ tight if $T=T^{\prec}$ and $\widehat{F}\not\mathrel{\mathsf{C}}P\setminus T$, for all finite $F\subseteq T$.
Definition \thedfn. For any $Q\subseteq P$ and $\prec\ \subseteq P\times P$, we define $Q^{\prec}=\{p\in P:Q\ni q\prec p\}.$ We extend $\prec$ to a binary relation on $\mathscr{P}(P)=\{Q:Q\subseteq P\}$ by defining $Q\prec R\qquad\Leftrightarrow\qquad Q\subseteq R^{\succ}\qquad\Leftrightarrow% \qquad\forall p\in P\ \exists q\in Q\ (p\prec q).$ From $\prec$ we define relations $\mathrel{\mathsf{D}}$ and $\mathrel{\mathsf{C}}$ on $\mathscr{P}(P)$ by $\displaystyle Q\mathrel{\mathsf{D}}R$ $\displaystyle\Leftrightarrow\qquad\forall q\prec Q\ \exists r\prec R\ (r\prec q).$ $\displaystyle Q\mathrel{\mathsf{C}}R$ $\displaystyle\Leftrightarrow\qquad\exists\text{ finite }F\ (Q\mathrel{\mathsf{% D}}F\prec R).$
Definition \thedfn. We call $T\subseteq P$ locally tight if $T\cap t^{\succ}$ is tight in $t^{\succ}$, for all $t\in T$.
Definition \thedfn. Assume $\prec$ is a transitive round relation on $P$, i.e. for all $p\in P$, $p^{\succ\succ}\subseteq p^{\succ}\neq\emptyset.$ We then call $(P,\prec)$ an abstract (local) (bi-)pseudobasis if, for all $p,q\in P$, $\displaystyle\forall p^{\prime}\prec p$ $\displaystyle p^{\prime\succ}$ $\displaystyle\mathrel{\mathsf{C}}p^{\succ}.$ $\displaystyle\forall p^{\prime}\prec p$ $\displaystyle\forall q^{\prime}\prec q$ $\displaystyle(p^{\prime\succ}\cap q^{\prime\succ})$ $\displaystyle\mathrel{\mathsf{C}}(p^{\succ}\cap q^{\succ}).$ $\displaystyle\forall r,s\preceq p\ \forall r^{\prime}\prec r$ $\displaystyle\forall s^{\prime}\prec s$ $\displaystyle(r^{\prime\succ}\cap s^{\prime\succ})$ $\displaystyle\mathrel{\mathsf{C}}(r^{\succ}\cap s^{\succ}).$ Here $\preceq$ denotes the lower preorder defined from $\prec$ by $p\preceq q\qquad\Leftrightarrow\qquad p^{\succ}\subseteq q^{\succ}.$
