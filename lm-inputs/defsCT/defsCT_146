Definition 2.9. Two maps $f$ and $g\colon\thinspace X\to Y$ in $\mathcal{M}$ are left $\mathcal{V}$-homotopic if there exists a map $H\colon\thinspace CS\otimes X\to Y$, called a left $\mathcal{V}$-homotopy, such that the following diagram commutes $\xymatrix{X\ar[d]\ar[dr]^{f}&\\ CS\otimes X\ar[r]^{H}&Y\\ X\ar[u]\ar[ur]_{g}&}$ where $CS$ is some cylinder object for $S$.
Definition 13.4. The $L$-stable model structure on ${\it Sp}^{\Sigma}(\mathcal{M},L)$ is obtained by localizing the level model structure with respect to the set of maps $F_{n+1}(C\otimes L)\to F_{n}(C),$ where $C$ runs through the sources and targets of the generating set of cofibrations $I_{\mathcal{M}}$ of $\mathcal{M}$. For details see [16, 8.7]. Here we use left properness of $\mathcal{M}$ to ensure, that all our $C$’s are cofibrant.
Definition 8.7. We define the following functor from $\mathcal{M}^{\mathcal{U}}$ to itself: $P_{L}^{L^{\prime}}\smash{\underset{\widetilde{\hphantom{X}}}{X}}\mathstrut=% \operatorname*{hocolim\,}_{n}R^{\prime n}\circ\smash{\underset{\widetilde{% \hphantom{X}}}{X}}\mathstrut^{h}\circ L^{n}.$ Here, of course, $R^{\prime}$ is the right adjoint to $L^{\prime}$ given by cotensoring with the object $L^{\prime}$. For $L=L^{\prime}$ we will write $P_{L}$ or, if no confusion can arise, we will drop the reference to $L$ and $L^{\prime}$ at all. The functor $P_{L}^{L^{\prime}}=P$ is coaugmented. Let $p\colon\thinspace\operatorname{id}\to P_{L}^{L^{\prime}}$ denote the coaugmentation. There is a commutative diagram $\displaystyle\begin{split}\displaystyle\xymatrix{P_{L}^{L^{\prime}}\ar[r]\ar[d% ]&\displaystyle P_{L}\ar[d]\\ \displaystyle P_{L^{\prime}}\ar[r]&\displaystyle P_{L^{\prime}}^{L}\end{split}}$ of coaugmented functors.
Definition 2.2. Let $\mathcal{V}$ be a closed symmetric monoidal category equipped with a model structure. Then $\mathcal{V}$ is a closed symmetric monoidal model category, if the two structures are compatible in the following sense: (i) For two cofibrations $i$ and $j$ in $\mathcal{V}$ their pushout product $i\,\square\,j$ is a cofibration, which is acyclic if either $i$ or $j$ is acyclic. (ii) For a cofibrant replacement $QS\to S$ of the unit $S$ the induced map $QS\otimes X\to S\otimes X\cong X$ is a weak equivalence for every object $X$ in $\mathcal{V}$.
Definition 7.6. Let $f\colon\thinspace A\to B$ be an arbitrary acyclic cofibration in $\mathcal{U}$ and consider the induced map $f^{*}\colon\thinspace R^{B}\to R^{A}$ of representable functors. Now factor $f^{*}$ into a projective cofibration $j\colon\thinspace R^{B}\to{\rm Cyl}(f^{*})$, which in the terminology of 2.13 is given by $j=i_{1}(f^{*})$, followed by the objectwise fibration $p\colon\thinspace{\rm Cyl}(f^{*})\to R^{A}$. Let us denote the set of all maps of the form $j$, where $f$ runs through the set of all acyclic cofibrations between objects in $\mathcal{U}$, by $J^{\prime}$. Then form the set $J^{\prime\prime}$ of pushout products $j\,\square\,i$, where $j\in J^{\prime}$ and $i\in I_{\mathcal{M}}$. Finally define the set of maps in $\mathcal{M}^{\mathcal{U}}$ $J^{\rm ho}_{\mathcal{M}^{\mathcal{U}}}:=J^{\prime\prime}\cup J_{\mathcal{M}^{% \mathcal{U}}}^{\rm proj}.$ Note that all maps in $J^{\prime\prime}$ are projective cofibrations by 6.1.
Definition 2.7. For the cofibrant unit $S$ of $\mathcal{V}$ let ${\rm Cyl}(S)$ denote an object obtained by factoring the fold map $S\sqcup S\to S$ into a cofibration $i\colon\thinspace S\sqcup S\to{\rm Cyl}(S)$ followed by a weak equivalence $p\colon\thinspace{\rm Cyl}(S)\to S$. We have two inclusions $S\to S\sqcup S$, which we can compose with the map $i$ to obtain two cofibrations $i_{0}$ and $i_{1}\colon\thinspace S\to{\rm Cyl}(S)$. These are section of the map $p$ and hence weak equivalences. We have the following diagram: $\xymatrix{S\sqcup S\ar[r]&CS\ar[r]^{-}p&S\ar@/^{1}0pt/[l]^{-}{i_{0}}\ar@/_{1}2% pt/[l]_{-}{i_{1}}}$ We emphasize, that for the moment there is a whole class of choices for ${\rm Cyl}(S)$.
Definition 3.1. Given an endofunctor $F\colon\mathcal{C}\to\mathcal{C}$ in a model category $\mathcal{C}$ equipped with a coaugmentation $\epsilon\colon\thinspace\operatorname{id}\to F$ we call a map $X\to Y$ in $\mathcal{C}$ an $F$-equivalence, if it induces a weak equivalence $FX\to FY$. A map $X\to Y$ is called an $F$-fibration, if it has the right lifting property with respect to all projective cofibrations, which are also $F$-equivalences.
Definition 2.1 We will denote by ${\bf SkeZLC}$ the category of all zero-dimensional locally compact Hausdorff spaces and all skeletal maps between them (see [4] for the definition of a skeletal map). Let ${\bf SkeZLBA}$ be the cofull subcategory of the category ${\bf ZLBA}$ whose morphisms are, in addition, complete homomorphisms.
Definitions 1.1 ([5]) Let ${\bf HLC}$ be the category of all locally compact Hausdorff spaces and all continuous maps between them. Let ${\bf DLC}$ be the category whose objects are all complete LCAs and whose morphisms are all functions $\varphi:(A,\rho,{\rm I}\!{\rm B})\longrightarrow(B,\eta,{\rm I}\!{\rm B}^{% \prime})$ between the objects of ${\bf DLC}$ satisfying conditions (DLC1) $\varphi(0)=0$; (DLC2) $\varphi(a\wedge b)=\varphi(a)\wedge\varphi(b)$, for all $a,b\in A$; (DLC3) If $a\in{\rm I}\!{\rm B},b\in A$ and $a\ll_{\rho}b$, then $(\varphi(a^{*}))^{*}\ll_{\eta}\varphi(b)$; (DLC4) For every $b\in{\rm I}\!{\rm B}^{\prime}$ there exists $a\in{\rm I}\!{\rm B}$ such that $b\leq\varphi(a)$; (DLC5) $\varphi(a)=\bigvee\{\varphi(b)\ |\ b\in{\rm I}\!{\rm B},b\ll_{\rho}a\}$, for every $a\in A$; let the composition $``\diamond$” of two morphisms $\varphi_{1}:(A_{1},\rho_{1},{\rm I}\!{\rm B}_{1})\longrightarrow(A_{2},\rho_{2% },{\rm I}\!{\rm B}_{2})$ and $\varphi_{2}:(A_{2},\rho_{2},{\rm I}\!{\rm B}_{2})\longrightarrow(A_{3},\rho_{3% },{\rm I}\!{\rm B}_{3})$ of ${\bf DLC}$ be defined by the formula $\varphi_{2}\diamond\varphi_{1}=(\varphi_{2}\circ\varphi_{1})\,\check{}\,,$ where, for every function $\psi:(A,\rho,{\rm I}\!{\rm B})\longrightarrow(B,\eta,{\rm I}\!{\rm B}^{\prime})$ between two objects of ${\bf DLC}$, $\psi\,\check{}\,:(A,\rho,{\rm I}\!{\rm B})\longrightarrow(B,\eta,{\rm I}\!{\rm B% }^{\prime})$ is defined as follows: $\psi\,\check{}\,(a)=\bigvee\{\psi(b)\ |\ b\in{\rm I}\!{\rm B},b\ll_{\rho}a\},$ for every $a\in A$.
Definition 1.6 ([6]) A pair $(A,I)$, where $A$ is a Boolean algebra and $I$ is an ideal of $A$ (possibly non proper) which is dense in $A$ (shortly, dense ideal), is called a local Boolean algebra (abbreviated as LBA). Two LBAs $(A,I)$ and $(B,J)$ are said to be isomorphic if there exists a Boolean isomorphism $\varphi:A\longrightarrow B$ such that $\varphi(I)=J$.
Definition 1.19 ([6]) We will denote by ${\bf PZLBA}$ the cofull subcategory of the category ${\bf ZLBA}$ whose morphisms $\varphi:(A,I)\longrightarrow(B,J)$ satisfy the following additional condition: (PZLBA) $\varphi(I)\subseteq J$.
Definition 4.1 [5] Let $(A,\rho,{\rm I}\!{\rm B})$ be an LCA. An ideal $I$ of $A$ is called a $\delta$-ideal if $I\subseteq{\rm I}\!{\rm B}$ and for any $a\in I$ there exists $b\in I$ such that $a\ll_{\rho}b$. If $I_{1}$ and $I_{2}$ are two $\delta$-ideals of $(A,\rho,{\rm I}\!{\rm B})$ then we put $I_{1}\leq I_{2}$ iff $I_{1}\subseteq I_{2}$. We will denote by $(I(A,\rho,{\rm I}\!{\rm B}),\leq)$ the poset of all $\delta$-ideals of $(A,\rho,{\rm I}\!{\rm B})$. Note that $I$ is a $\delta$-ideal of $(A,\rho_{s},{\rm I}\!{\rm B})$ iff it is an ideal of ${\rm I}\!{\rm B}$ (see 1.7 for $\rho_{s}$).
Definitions 1.3 ([3, 5]) Let ${\bf PLC}$ be the cofull subcategory of the category ${\bf HLC}$ whose morphisms are perfect maps. Let ${\bf PDLC}$ be the cofull subcategory of the category ${\bf DLC}$ whose morphisms are all ${\bf DLC}$-morphisms $\varphi:(A,\rho,{\rm I}\!{\rm B})\longrightarrow(B,\eta,{\rm I}\!{\rm B}^{% \prime})$ satisfying the following condition: (PAL5) If $a\in{\rm I}\!{\rm B}$ then $\varphi(a)\in{\rm I}\!{\rm B}^{\prime}$.
Definition 1.14 ([6]) An LBA $(B,I)$ is called a ZLB-algebra (briefly, ZLBA) if, for every $J\in Si(I)$, the join $\bigvee_{B}J$($=\bigvee_{B}\{a\ |\ a\in J\}$) exists. Let ${\bf ZLBA}$ be the category whose objects are all ZLBAs and whose morphisms are all functions $\varphi:(B,I)\longrightarrow(B_{1},I_{1})$ between the objects of ${\bf ZLBA}$ such that $\varphi:B\longrightarrow B_{1}$ is a Boolean homomorphism satisfying the following condition: (ZLBA) For every $b\in I_{1}$ there exists $a\in I$ such that $b\leq\varphi(a)$; let the composition between the morphisms of ${\bf ZLBA}$ be the usual composition between functions, and the ${\bf ZLBA}$-identities be the identity functions.
Definition 2.13 Let $\varphi\in{\bf GBPL}(J,I)$. If $\psi:I\longrightarrow J$ is a map which satisfies conditions (OZL1) and (OZL2) (see 2.8) then $\psi$ is called a lower preadjoint of $\varphi$. Let ${\bf OGBPL}$ be the cofull subcategory of the category ${\bf GBPL}$ whose morphisms have, in addition, lower preadjoints.
Definition 4.1. (Definition 3.1.1 in [B]) Let $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$ be categories, and $F\colon A\rightarrow B$ be a functor. For any $B\in\mathcal{B}$, a reflection of $B$ along $F$ is a pair $(R_{B},\eta_{B})$ of $R_{B}\in\mathcal{A}$ and $\eta_{B}\in\mathcal{B}(B,F(R_{B}))$, satisfying the following universality: $\mathrm{(\ast)}$ For any $A\in\mathcal{A}$ and any $b\in\mathcal{B}(B,F(A))$, there exists a unique morphism $a\in\mathcal{A}(R_{B},A)$ such that $F(a)\circ\eta_{B}=b$. $\xy(0,-8)*+{F(A)}="0";(-10,6)*+{B}="2";(10,6)*+{F(R_{B})}="4";(0,8)*+{}="6";{% \ar_{b}"2";"0"};{\ar^{\eta_{B}}"2";"4"};{\ar^{F(a)}"4";"0"};{\ar@{}|% \circlearrowright"0";"6"};\endxy$ A coreflection is defined dually.
Definition 8.1. (§§5.1 in [KR]) A full additive thick subcategory $\mathcal{T}\subseteq\mathcal{C}$ is an $n$-cluster tilting subcategory if it satisfies the following. (1) $\mathcal{T}$ is functorially finite. (2) An object $C\in\mathcal{C}$ belongs to $\mathcal{T}$ if and only if $\mathrm{Ext}^{\ell}(C,\mathcal{T})=0\ \ (0<{}^{\forall}\ell<n)$ (3) An object $C\in\mathcal{C}$ belongs to $\mathcal{T}$ if and only if $\mathrm{Ext}^{\ell}(\mathcal{T},C)=0\ \ (0<{}^{\forall}\ell<n)$
Definition 3.5. $\ \ $ (1) $\mathcal{C}^{+}$ is defined to be the full subcategory of $\mathcal{C}$, consisting of objects satisfying equivalent conditions of Corollary 3.3. (2) $\mathcal{C}^{-}$ is defined to be the full subcategory of $\mathcal{C}$, consisting of objects satisfying equivalent conditions of Corollary 3.4.
Definition 2.7. (cf. §§2.1 in [KZ]) Let $(\mathcal{U},\mathcal{V})$ be a cotorsion pair in $\mathcal{C}$, and $\mathcal{W}:=\mathcal{U}\cap\mathcal{V}$. We denote the quotient of $\mathcal{C}$ by $\mathcal{W}$ as $\underline{\mathcal{C}}:=\mathcal{C}/\mathcal{W}.$ Namely, $\mathrm{Ob}(\underline{\mathcal{C}})=\mathrm{Ob}(\mathcal{C})$, and for any $A,B\in\mathcal{C}$, $\underline{\mathcal{C}}(A,B):=\mathcal{C}(A,B)/\{f\in\mathcal{C}(A,B)\mid f\ % \text{factors through some}\ W\in\mathcal{W}\}.$ For any morphism $f\in\mathcal{C}(A,B)$, we denote its image in $\underline{\mathcal{C}}(A,B)$ by $\underline{f}$. This defines an additive functor $\underline{(\ \ )}\colon\mathcal{C}\rightarrow\underline{\mathcal{C}}\ .$ Since $\mathcal{U}\supseteq\mathcal{W}$ and $\mathcal{V}\supseteq\mathcal{W}$, we also have additive full subcategories of $\underline{\mathcal{C}}$ $\underline{\mathcal{U}}:=\mathcal{U}/\mathcal{W}\ \ \text{and}\ \ \underline{% \mathcal{V}}:=\mathcal{V}/\mathcal{W}.$
Definition 3.7. For any cotorsion pair $(\mathcal{U},\mathcal{V})$, put $\mathcal{H}:=\mathcal{C}^{+}\cap\mathcal{C}^{-}$. Since $\mathcal{H}\supseteq\mathcal{W}$, we have an additive full subcategory $\underline{\mathcal{H}}:=\mathcal{H}/\mathcal{W}\subseteq\underline{\mathcal{C% }},$ which we call the heart of $(\mathcal{U},\mathcal{V})$.
Definition 8.2. Let $\mathcal{T}$ be an $n+1$-cluster tilting subcategory. For any pair of integers $i$ and $j$ satisfying $i\leq j$, put $\displaystyle\mathcal{T}_{[i,j]}$ $\displaystyle:=$ $\displaystyle\{C\in\mathcal{C}\mid\mathrm{Ext}^{\ell}(C,\mathcal{T})=0\ \ (j+1% \leq{}^{\forall}\ell\leq n)\},$ $\displaystyle\mathcal{T}^{[i,j]}$ $\displaystyle:=$ $\displaystyle\{C\in\mathcal{C}\mid\mathrm{Ext}^{\ell}(\mathcal{T},C)=0\ \ (-j% \leq{}^{\forall}\ell\leq-i)\}.$ In particular, if $j-i\geq n$, then $\mathcal{T}_{[i,j]}=\mathcal{T}_{[i,j]}=\mathcal{C}$.
Definition 2.1. Let $\mathcal{U}$ and $\mathcal{V}$ be full additive thick subcategories of $\mathcal{C}$. We call $(\mathcal{U},\mathcal{V})$ a cotorsion pair if it satisfies the following. (1) $\mathrm{Ext}^{1}(\mathcal{U},\mathcal{V})=0$, (2) For any $C\in\mathcal{C}$, there exists a (not necessarily unique) distinguished triangle $U\rightarrow C\rightarrow V[1]\rightarrow U[1]$ satisfying $U\in\mathcal{U}$ and $V\in\mathcal{V}$. For any cotorsion pair $(\mathcal{U},\mathcal{V})$, put $\mathcal{W}:=\mathcal{U}\cap\mathcal{V}.$
Definition 3.1. Let $\mathbb{T}$ be a geometric theory over a signature $\Sigma$ and $\phi(\vec{x})$ a geometric formula-in-context over $\Sigma$. Then (i) we say that $\phi(\vec{x})$ is $\mathbb{T}$-complete if the sequent ($\phi\vdash_{\vec{x}}\bot$) is not provable in $\mathbb{T}$, and for every geometric formula $\phi$ in the same context either ($\chi\vdash_{\vec{x}}\bot$) or ($\chi\wedge\phi\vdash_{\vec{x}}\bot$) is provable in $\mathbb{T}$; (ii) we say that $\phi(\vec{x})$ is $\mathbb{T}$-indecomposable if for any family $\{\psi_{i}(\vec{x})\textrm{ | }i\in I\}$ of geometric formulae in the same context such that for each $i$, $\psi_{i}$ $\mathbb{T}$-provably implies $\phi$ and for any distinct $i,j\in I$, $\psi_{i}\wedge\psi_{j}\vdash_{\vec{x}}\bot$ is provable in $\mathbb{T}$, we have that $\phi\vdash_{\vec{x}}\mathbin{\mathop{\textrm{\huge$\vee$}}\limits_{i\in I}}% \psi_{i}$ provable in $\mathbb{T}$ implies $\phi\vdash_{\vec{x}}\psi_{i}$ provable in $\mathbb{T}$ for some $i\in I$; (iii) we say that $\phi(\vec{x})$ is $\mathbb{T}$-irreducible if for any family $\{\theta_{i}\textrm{ | }i\in I\}$ of $\mathbb{T}$-provably functional geometric formulae $\{\vec{x_{i}},\vec{x}.\theta_{i}\}$ from $\{\vec{x_{i}}.\phi_{i}\}$ to $\{\vec{x}.\phi\}$ such that $\phi\vdash_{\vec{x}}\mathbin{\mathop{\textrm{\huge$\vee$}}\limits_{i\in I}}(% \exists\vec{x_{i}})\theta_{i}$ is provable in $\mathbb{T}$, there exist $i\in I$ and a $\mathbb{T}$-provably functional geometric formula $\{\vec{x},\vec{x_{i}}.\theta^{\prime}\}$ from $\{\vec{x}.\phi\}$ to $\{\vec{x_{i}}.\phi_{i}\}$ such that $\phi\vdash_{\vec{x}}(\exists\vec{x_{i}})(\theta^{\prime}\wedge\theta_{i})$ is provable in $\mathbb{T}$; (iv) we say that $\phi(\vec{x})$ is $\mathbb{T}$-compact if for any family $\{\psi_{i}(\vec{x})\textrm{ | }i\in I\}$ of geometric formulae in the same context, $\phi\vdash_{\vec{x}}\mathbin{\mathop{\textrm{\huge$\vee$}}\limits_{i\in I}}% \psi_{i}$ provable in $\mathbb{T}$ implies $\phi\vdash_{\vec{x}}\mathbin{\mathop{\textrm{\huge$\vee$}}\limits_{i\in I^{% \prime}}}\psi_{i}$ provable in $\mathbb{T}$ for some finite subset $I^{\prime}$ of $I$; (v) we say that $\phi(\vec{x})$ is $\mathbb{T}$-supercompact if for any family $\{\psi_{i}(\vec{x})\textrm{ | }i\in I\}$ of geometric formulae in the same context, $\phi\vdash_{\vec{x}}\mathbin{\mathop{\textrm{\huge$\vee$}}\limits_{i\in I}}% \psi_{i}$ provable in $\mathbb{T}$ implies $\phi\vdash_{\vec{x}}\psi_{i}$ provable in $\mathbb{T}$ for some $i\in I$.
Definition 2.1. Let $({\cal C},J)$ be a site. We say a subcategory $\cal D$ of $\cal C$ is $J$-dense if (i) every object $c$ of $\cal C$ has a covering sieve $R\in J(c)$ generated by morphisms whose domains are in $\cal D$; and (ii) for any morphism $f:c\to d$ in $\cal C$ with $d\in{\cal D}$, there is a covering sieve $R\in J(c)$ generated by morphisms $g:b\to c$ for which the composite $f\circ g$ is in $\cal D$.
Definition 2.3. Let $\cal E$ be a Grothendieck topos and $A$ an object of $\cal E$. Then (i) $A$ is said to be an atom if the only subobjects of $A$ in $\cal E$ are the identity on $A$ and the zero subobject, and they are distinct from each other; (ii) $A$ is said to be indecomposable if does not admit any non-trivial coproduct decompositions; (iii) $A$ is said to be irreducible if it is $J_{\cal E}$-irreducible, where $J_{\cal E}$ is the canonical topology on $\cal E$; in other words, if any sieve in $\cal E$ containing a small epimorphic family contains the identity on $A$; (iv) $A$ is said to be compact if every small covering family $\{A_{i}\to A\textrm{ | }i\in I\}$ contains a finite covering subfamily; (v) $A$ is said to be coherent if it is compact and, whenever we are given a morphism $f:B\to A$ with $B$ compact, the domain of the kernel-pair of $f$ is compact; (vi) $A$ is said to be supercompact if every small covering family $\{A_{i}\to A\textrm{ | }i\in I\}$ contains a cover; (vii) $A$ is said to be regular if it is supercompact and, whenever we are given a morphism $f:B\to A$ with $B$ supercompact, the domain of the kernel-pair of $f$ is supercompact.
Definition 5.1. Let $\mathcal{C}$ be an abelian symmetric monoidal category. A Lie algebra in $\mathcal{C}$ is an object $L\in\mathcal{C}$ together with a morphism $l=[-,-]:\ L\otimes L\to L$ such that $l\circ(id+c_{L,L})=0,$ and $l^{2}\circ(id+b(t^{3},t^{3}s)_{L,L,L}+b(t^{3},t^{3}s^{2})_{L,L,L})=0,$ where $l^{2}=l\circ(L\otimes l)$.
Definition 12. For any essentially finite 2-group $\mathbb{G}$ the regular representation of $\mathbb{G}$ is the representation $\mathbf{R}$ defined by the pair $(\mathcal{V}ect_{k}^{\mathcal{G}},\mathbb{F}_{\mathbf{R}})$ with $\mathbb{F}_{\mathbf{R}}=(F_{\mathbf{R}},\mu)$ the above morphism of 2-groups.
Definition 1. A 2-vector space is a (small) $k$-additive category $\mathcal{V}$ which admits a finite (possibly empty) basis of absolutely simple objects.
Definition 6.5. The data $\langle\mathcal{C},\mathbf{F}\rangle$ consisting of a small additive monoidal category $\mathcal{C}$ and an essentially strong monoidal additive functor $\mathbf{F}:\mathcal{C}\to\mathsf{Ab}$ is called a fiber functor if in the (up to isomorphism unique) factorization $\mathcal{C}\stackrel{{\scriptstyle F}}{{\longrightarrow}}\,_{R}\mathcal{M}_{R}% \stackrel{{\scriptstyle\phi}}{{\longrightarrow}}\mathcal{M}_{R}\to\mathsf{Ab}$ of $\mathbf{F}$, with $F$ strong monoidal, the functor $F^{\sharp}:=\phi F:\mathcal{C}\to\mathcal{M}_{R}$ satisfies the following conditions: • $F^{\sharp}$ is faithful, flat and reflects isomorphisms, • $F^{\sharp}C$ is f.g. projective for all $C\in\operatorname{ob}\mathcal{C}$, • $\mathcal{C}$ has kernels of arrows $t$ for which $F^{\sharp}t$ is epi, • $\mathcal{C}$ has cokernels of arrows $t$ for which $F^{\sharp}t$ is von Neumann regular and $F^{\sharp}$ preserves such cokernels.
Definition 5.1. The monoidal idempotent monad $\mathsf{T}$ is called special if it satisfies the invertibility condition of (4.13).
Definition 7.1. A set $\mathcal{I}\subset\operatorname{ob}\mathcal{C}$ of objects in a monoidal $\mathsf{Ab}$-category is called a bounded fusion system if • $\{YA|A\in\mathcal{I}\}$ is a generator system in the category $\hat{\mathcal{C}}$ of presheaves • and there is a choice of direct summand diagrams (7.3) the multiplicities $M^{B}_{A,C}$ of which satisfy that there exist finite numbers $m_{C}$ for all $C\in\mathcal{I}$ (equivalently, for all $C\in\operatorname{ob}\mathcal{C}$) such that $\sum_{A\in\mathcal{I}}M^{B}_{A,C}\ \leq\ m_{C}\,,\qquad\forall B\in\mathcal{I}% \quad\text{and}\quad\forall C\in\mathcal{I}\ (\forall C\in\operatorname{ob}% \mathcal{C})\,.$ The category $\mathcal{C}$ itself is called to have bounded fusion if there exists a bounded fusion system $\mathcal{I}\subset\operatorname{ob}\mathcal{C}$.
Definition 5.6. Let $\mathcal{T}$ be a Grothendieck topology on the underlying $\mathsf{Ab}$-category of the small monoidal $\mathsf{Ab}$-category $\mathcal{C}$ and let $\mathsf{T}=\langle T,\mu,\nu\rangle$ be its left exact idempotent monad. Then we say that $\mathcal{T}$ is monoidal if $T(U\odot\nu_{V})$ and $T(\nu_{U}\odot V)$ are invertible for all $U,V\in\operatorname{ob}\hat{\mathcal{C}}$. In this case the pair $\langle\mathcal{C},\mathcal{T}\rangle$ is called a monoidal site.
Definition 7.4. In any $\mathsf{Ab}$-category an arrow $s$ is a weak kernel of the arrow $t$ if (1) $t\circ s=0$ (2) and if $t\circ q=0$ then there is an arrow $r$ such that $q=s\circ r$.
Definition 2.1. Given $n\in\mathbb{N}$, let $I_{n}$ be the following category. The objects of $I_{n}$ are the integers $0,1,\cdots,n$ and the morphisms, other than the identities, are defined as follows. If $r$ and $s$ are two distinct objects in $I_{n}$ there is exactly one morphism from $r$ to $s$ if $r$ is even and $s=r-1$ or $s=r+1$ and no morphism otherwise. A sketch of $I_{n}$ is as follow (case $n$ even). $I_{n}:0\longrightarrow 1\longleftarrow 2\longrightarrow\cdots\longleftarrow n$ Let $C$ be a small category, denote the set of objects of $C$ by $C_{0}$. Define a set $\pi_{0}(C)=C_{0}/\sim$ where $a\sim b$ iff there exists a functor $\alpha:I_{n}\longrightarrow C$ such that $\alpha(0)=a$ and $\alpha(n)=b$ for some $n$. $\pi_{0}(C)$ is called the set of path component of $C$.
Definition 2.0.1. A tensor category is a category $\mathcal{C}$ with a covariant functor $\otimes:\mathcal{C}\times\mathcal{C}\rightarrow\mathcal{C}$, a natural isomorphism $\alpha:(\mathcal{C}\otimes\mathcal{C})\otimes\mathcal{C}\rightarrow\mathcal{C}% \otimes(\mathcal{C}\otimes\mathcal{C})$, called associativity, satisfying the pentagon axiom, a tensor unit $\textbf{1}\in\mathcal{C}$ and natural isomorphisms $\rho:\mathcal{C}\otimes\textbf{1}\rightarrow\mathcal{C}$ and $\lambda:\textbf{1}\otimes\mathcal{C}\rightarrow\mathcal{C}$ satisfying the triangle axiom. A tensor category is called strict if $\alpha,\rho$ and $\lambda$ are identity. For an algebraically closed field $k$, a tensor category is $k$-linear if all $\operatorname{Hom}$-spaces are $k$-linear vector spaces, composition of morphisms are $k$-bilinear, and $\otimes$ is $k$-bilinear on morphisms. In a $k$-linear tensor category, an object $x$ in $\mathcal{C}$ is said to be simple if the map $k\rightarrow\operatorname{End}(x)$, $c\mapsto c\cdot\operatorname{id}_{x}$, is an isomorphism. A $k$-linear tensor category is said to be semi-simple if every object is isomorphic to a direct sum of finitely many simple objects.
Definition 2.0.2. A tensor category $\mathcal{C}$ is rigid if it has right and left rigidity. A fusion category is a $k$-linear semi-simple rigid tensor category with finitely many isomorphism classes of simple objects, finite dimensional spaces of morphisms, and $\operatorname{End}(\textbf{1})\cong k$. In a strict tensor category $\mathcal{C}$ with a strict pivotal structure, for any endomorphism $f\in\operatorname{End}_{\mathcal{C}}({x})$ the right trace is defined by $\operatorname{tr}_{r}(f)=d_{x^{*}}\circ(f\otimes\operatorname{id}_{x^{*}})% \circ b_{x}$ and the left trace is defined by $\operatorname{tr}_{l}(f)=d_{x}\circ(\operatorname{id}_{x^{*}}\otimes f)\circ b% _{x^{*}}$. Category $\mathcal{C}$ is spherical if $\operatorname{tr}_{r}(f)=\operatorname{tr}_{l}(f)$ for all $f$, and in this case we denote it by $\operatorname{tr}(f)$. In a spherical category the quantum dimension $\dim(x)$ of an object $x$ is defined by $\operatorname{tr}(\operatorname{id}_{x})$.
Definition 5.1.1. Let $\underline{C}_{0}$ be a (full) subcategory of $\underline{C}$, $M\in\operatorname{Obj}\underline{C}$; let $L$ be a small (index) category, $N:L\to\underline{C}:l\mapsto N_{l}$ is a functor. 1. Let $M$ be a co-cone of $N$ (i.e., $N$ is equipped with compatible morphisms from $N_{l}$ for $l\in L$). Then we will say that $M$ is a $\underline{C}_{0}$-colimit of $N_{l}$ if the restriction $H_{M}$ of the functor $\underline{C}(-,M)$ to $\underline{C}_{0}$ equals the colimit of $H_{N_{l}}$ (in $\operatorname{PShv}(\underline{C}_{0})$, i.e., if for any $Y\in\operatorname{Obj}\underline{C}_{0}$ the connecting morphisms induce an isomorphism $\underline{C}(Y,N)\cong\operatorname{\varinjlim}\underline{C}(Y,N_{l})$). 2. If $M$ is a cone of $N$ then we will say that $M$ is a $\underline{C}_{0}$-limit of $N$ if $M$ is a $\underline{C}_{0}^{op}$-colimit of $N_{l}$ in $\underline{C}^{op}$.
Definition 2.2.3. Assume that $\underline{C}$ is endowed with a weight structure $w$. 1. We will call a filtration (see Definition 2.2.1) ${\operatorname{Fil}}_{*}M$ of $M\in\operatorname{Obj}\underline{C}$ a weight filtration (of $M$) if the morphisms $h_{i}:M_{\leq i}\to M$ yield $i$-weight decompositions (i.e., $M_{\leq i}=w_{\leq i}M$) for all $i\in{\mathbb{Z}}$. We will call the corresponding $Po_{\operatorname{Fil}}$ a weight Postnikov tower for $M$. 2. $\operatorname{Post}_{w}(\underline{C})$ will denote the category whose objects are objects of $\underline{C}$ endowed with arbitrary weight Postnikov towers and whose morphisms are morphisms of Postnikov towers. $\underline{C}_{w}$ will be the category whose objects are the same as for $\operatorname{Post}_{w}(\underline{C})$ and such that $\underline{C}_{w}(Po_{{\operatorname{Fil}}_{M}},Po_{{\operatorname{Fil}}_{M^{% \prime}}})=\operatorname{\operatorname{Im}}(\operatorname{Post}_{w}(\underline% {C})(Po_{{\operatorname{Fil}}_{M}},Po_{{\operatorname{Fil}}_{M^{\prime}}})\to% \underline{C}(M,M^{\prime}))$ (i.e., we kill those morphisms of towers that are zero on the underlying objects). 3. For an additive category $\underline{B}$, complexes $A,B\in\operatorname{Obj}K(\underline{B})$, and morphisms $m_{1},m_{2}\in C({\underline{Hw}})(A,B)$ we will write $m_{1}\backsim m_{2}$ if $m_{1}-m_{2}=d_{B}h+jd_{A}$ for some collections of arrows $j^{*},h^{*}:A^{*}\to B^{*-1}$. We will call this relation the weak homotopy one.24This relation was earlier introduced in [Bar05]; $m_{1}$ is absolutely homologous to $m_{2}$ in the terminology of that paper. Respectively, some of the results below concerning this equivalence relation were proved in ibid.
Definition 1.1.3. Assume that $\underline{C}$ has coproducts; $\mathcal{P}\subset\operatorname{Obj}\underline{C}$. 1. An object $M$ of $\underline{C}$ is said to be compact if the functor $H^{M}=\underline{C}(M,-):\underline{C}\to\underline{\operatorname{Ab}}$ respects coproducts. 2. For $\underline{D}\subset\underline{C}$ ($\underline{D}$ is a triangulated category that may be equal to $\underline{C}$) one says that $\mathcal{P}$ generates $\underline{D}$ as a localizing subcategory of $\underline{C}$ if $\underline{D}$ is the smallest full strict triangulated subcategory of $\underline{C}$ that contains $\mathcal{P}$ and is closed with respect to $\underline{C}$-coproducts. Dually, we will say that $\mathcal{P}$ cogenerates $\underline{D}{{}^{op}}$ as a colocalizing subcategory of $\underline{C}{{}^{op}}$. 3. We will say that $\mathcal{P}$ Hom-generates a full triangulated category $\underline{D}$ of $\underline{C}$ containing $\mathcal{P}$ if $\operatorname{Obj}\underline{D}\cap(\cup_{i\in{\mathbb{Z}}}\mathcal{P}[i]){}^{% \perp}=\{0\}$. 4. We will say that $\underline{C}$ is compactly generated if it is Hom-generated by a set of compact objects. 5. It will be convenient for us to use the following somewhat clumsy terminology: a homological functor $H:\underline{C}\to\underline{A}$ (where $\underline{A}$ is an abelian category) will be called a cc functor if it respects coproducts (i.e., the image of any coproduct in $\underline{C}$ is the corresponding coproduct in $\underline{A}$); $H$ will be called a wcc functor if it respect countable coproducts. A cohomological functor $H$ from $\underline{C}$ into $\underline{A}$ will be called a cp functor if it converts all (small) coproducts into $\underline{A}$-products. Dually, for a triangulated category $\underline{D}$ that has products we will call a homological functor $H:\underline{D}\to\underline{A}$ a pp functor if its respects products. 6. We will say that $\underline{C}$ satisfies the Brown representability property whenever any cp functor from $\underline{C}$ into $\underline{\operatorname{Ab}}$ is representable. Dually, we will say that a triangulated category $\underline{D}$ satisfies the dual Brown representability property if it has products and any pp functor from $\underline{C}$ into $\underline{\operatorname{Ab}}$ is corepresentable (i.e., if $\underline{D}{{}^{op}}$ satisfies the Brown representability property).
Definition 1.2.1. A couple $s$ of classes $\mathcal{LO},\mathcal{RO}\subset\operatorname{Obj}\underline{C}$ (of $s$-left orthogonal and $s$-right orthogonal objects, respectively) will be said to be a torsion pair (for $\underline{C}$) if $\mathcal{LO}^{\perp}=\mathcal{RO}$, $\mathcal{LO}={}^{\perp}\mathcal{RO}$, and for any $M\in\operatorname{Obj}\underline{C}$ there exists a distinguished triangle $L_{s}M\stackrel{{\scriptstyle a_{M}}}{{\to}}M\stackrel{{\scriptstyle n_{M}}}{{% \to}}R_{s}M{\to}L_{s}M[1]$ such that $L_{s}M\in\mathcal{LO}$ and $R_{s}M\in\mathcal{RO}$. We will call any triangle of this form an $s$-decomposition of $M$; $a_{M}$ will be called an $s$-decomposition morphism.
Definition 1.3.6. Let $t$ be a $t$-structure on $\underline{C}$. Then we will write $P_{t}$ for the class ${}^{\perp}(\underline{D}^{t\geq 1}\cup\underline{D}^{t\leq-1})$; we will say that its elements are $t$-projective.21The class $P_{t}$ was called the coheart of $t$ in §3 of [NSZ15].
Definition 3.3.4. Let $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{P}^{\prime}$ be subclasses of $\operatorname{Obj}\underline{C}$, $P\in\operatorname{Obj}\underline{C}$. 1. We will say that $\mathcal{P}$ is weakly symmetric to $\mathcal{P}^{\prime}$ if $\mathcal{P}{}^{\perp}={}^{\perp}\mathcal{P}^{\prime}$. 2. We will say that a $\underline{C}$-morphism $h$ is $\mathcal{P}$-conull whenever for all $M\in\mathcal{P}$ we have $H_{M}(h)=0$ (where $H_{M}=\underline{C}(-,M):\underline{C}{{}^{op}}\to\underline{\operatorname{Ab}}$). 3. We will say that $\mathcal{P}$ is symmetric to $\mathcal{P}^{\prime}$ if the class $\mathcal{P}$-null (see Definition 1.2.2(5)) coincides with the class of $\mathcal{P}^{\prime}$-conull morphisms. 4. Let $H:\underline{C}\to\underline{\operatorname{Ab}}$ be a homological functor. Then we will call the functor $\widehat{H}:M\mapsto\underline{\operatorname{Ab}}(H(M),{\mathbb{Q}}/{\mathbb{Z% }}):\underline{C}\to\underline{\operatorname{Ab}}$ the Brown-Comenetz dual of $H$. 5. We will call an object of $\underline{C}$ the Brown-Comenetz dual of $P$ and denote it by $\hat{P}$ if it represents the Brown-Comenetz dual of the functor $H^{M}=\underline{C}(M,-):\underline{C}\to\underline{\operatorname{Ab}}$.
Definition 1.3.1. A couple of subclasses $\underline{C}^{t\geq 0},\underline{C}^{t\leq 0}\subset\operatorname{Obj}% \underline{C}$ will be said to be a $t$-structure $t$ on $\underline{C}$ if they satisfy the following conditions: (i) $\underline{C}^{t\geq 0},\underline{C}^{t\leq 0}$ are strict, i.e., contain all objects of $\underline{C}$ isomorphic to their elements. (ii) $\underline{C}^{t\geq 0}\subset\underline{C}^{t\geq 0}[1]$, $\underline{C}^{t\leq 0}[1]\subset\underline{C}^{t\leq 0}$. (iii) $\underline{C}^{t\leq 0}[1]\perp\underline{C}^{t\geq 0}$. (iv) For any $M\in\operatorname{Obj}\underline{C}$ there exists a $t$-decomposition distinguished triangle $LM\to M\to RM{\to}LM[1]$ such that $LM\in\underline{C}^{t\leq 0},RM\in\underline{C}^{t\geq 0}[-1]$.
Definition 2.4.3. 1. Let $m,n\in{\mathbb{Z}}$; let $H$ be as above. Then we will say that $H$ is of weight range $\geq m$ (resp. $\leq n$, resp. $[m,n]$) if it annihilates $\underline{C}_{w\leq m-1}$ (resp. $\underline{C}_{w\geq n+1}$, resp. both of these classes). 2. Let $A:{\underline{Hw}}^{op}\to\underline{A}$ be an additive functor. Then for $A^{op}$ being the opposite functor ${\underline{Hw}}\to\underline{A}^{op}$ we will denote by $H_{A}$ the cohomological functor from $\underline{C}$ into $\underline{A}$ obtained from $H^{A^{op}}$ (see Proposition 2.3.1) by means of reversion of arrows. We will functors obtained using this construction pure cohomological ones.
Definition 1.2.2. Let $s=(\mathcal{LO},\mathcal{RO})$ be a torsion pair. 1. We will say that $s$ is coproductive (resp. productive) if $\mathcal{RO}$ is coproductive (resp. $\mathcal{LO}$ is productive). We will also say that $s$ is smashing (resp. cosmashing) if $\underline{C}$ in addition has coproducts (resp. products). We will also use the following modification of the smashing condition: we will say that $s$ is weakly smashing whenever $\underline{C}$ has coproducts and $\mathcal{RO}$ is weakly coproductive and closed with respect to countable $\underline{C}$-coproducts. 2. For another torsion pair $s^{\prime}=(\mathcal{LO}^{\prime},\mathcal{RO}^{\prime})$ for $\underline{C}$ we will say that $s$ is left adjacent to $s^{\prime}$ or that $s^{\prime}$ is right adjacent to $s$ if $\mathcal{RO}=\mathcal{LO}^{\prime}$. 3. We will say (following [PoS16, Definition 3.1]) that $s$ is generated by $\mathcal{P}\subset\mathcal{LO}$ if $\mathcal{P}^{\perp}=\mathcal{RO}$.17It suffices to assume that $\mathcal{P}\subset\operatorname{Obj}\underline{C}$ and $\mathcal{P}^{\perp}=\mathcal{RO}$ since then $\mathcal{P}$ certainly lies in $\mathcal{LO}$. We will say that $s$ is compactly generated if it is generated by some set of compact objects. 4. For $\underline{C}^{\prime}$ being a full triangulated subcategory of $\underline{C}$ we will say that $s$ restricts to it whenever $(\mathcal{LO}\cap\operatorname{Obj}\underline{C}^{\prime},\mathcal{RO}\cap% \operatorname{Obj}\underline{C}^{\prime})$ is a torsion pair for $\underline{C}^{\prime}$. 5. For a class $\mathcal{P}\subset\operatorname{Obj}\underline{C}$ we will say that a $\underline{C}$-morphism $h$ is $\mathcal{P}$-null whenever for all $M\in\mathcal{P}$ we have $H^{M}(h)=0$ (where $H^{M}=\underline{C}(M,-):\underline{C}\to\underline{\operatorname{Ab}}$).18Note that the class of $\mathcal{P}$-null morphisms is not necessarily shift-stable in contrast to the main examples of the paper [Chr98] where this notion was introduced.
Definition 2.1.2. Let $i,j\in{\mathbb{Z}}$. 1. The full subcategory ${\underline{Hw}}\subset\underline{C}$ whose object class is $\underline{C}_{w=0}=\underline{C}_{w\geq 0}\cap\underline{C}_{w\leq 0}$ is called the heart of $w$. 2. $\underline{C}_{w\geq i}$ (resp. $\underline{C}_{w\leq i}$, $\underline{C}_{w=i}$) will denote $\underline{C}_{w\geq 0}[i]$ (resp. $\underline{C}_{w\leq 0}[i]$, $\underline{C}_{w=0}[i]$). 3. $\underline{C}_{[i,j]}$ denotes $\underline{C}_{w\geq i}\cap\underline{C}_{w\leq j}$; so, this class equals $\{0\}$ if $i>j$. $\underline{C}^{b}\subset\underline{C}$ will be the category whose object class is $\cup_{i,j\in{\mathbb{Z}}}\underline{C}_{[i,j]}$. 4. We will say that $(\underline{C},w)$ is bounded if $\underline{C}^{b}=\underline{C}$ (i.e., if $\cup_{i\in{\mathbb{Z}}}\underline{C}_{w\leq i}=\operatorname{Obj}\underline{C}% =\cup_{i\in{\mathbb{Z}}}\underline{C}_{w\geq i}$). Respectively, we will call $\cup_{i\in{\mathbb{Z}}}\underline{C}_{w\leq i}$ (resp. $\cup_{i\in{\mathbb{Z}}}\underline{C}_{w\geq i}$) the class of $w$-bounded above (resp. $w$-bounded below) objects; we will say that $w$ is bounded above (resp. bounded below) if all the objects of $\underline{C}$ satisfy this property. 5. We will call the elements of $\cap_{i\in{\mathbb{Z}}}\underline{C}_{w\leq i}$ (resp. of $\cap_{i\in{\mathbb{Z}}}\underline{C}_{w\geq i}$) right degenerate (resp. left degenerate). Respectively, we will say that $w$ is non-degenerate if $\cap_{i\in{\mathbb{Z}}}\underline{C}_{w\leq i}=\cap_{i\in{\mathbb{Z}}}% \underline{C}_{w\geq i}=\{0\}$ (i.e., if all degenerate objects of $\underline{C}$ are trivial). We will say that $w$ is right non-degenerate (resp. left non-degenerate) if $\bigcap\limits_{i\in{\mathbb{Z}}}\underline{C}_{w\leq i}=\{0\}$ (resp. $\bigcap\limits_{i\in{\mathbb{Z}}}\underline{C}_{w\geq i}=\{0\}$). 6. If $t$ is a $t$-structure on $\underline{C}$ then we will say that $w$ is left adjacent to $t$ or that $t$ is right adjacent to $w$ if $\underline{C}_{w\geq 0}=\underline{C}^{t\leq 0}$. Dually, $w$ is right adjacent to $t$ whenever $\underline{C}_{w\leq 0}=\underline{C}^{t\geq 0}$. 7. An additive subcategory $D\subset\operatorname{Obj}\underline{C}$ will be called negative if for any $i>0$ we have $\operatorname{Obj}D\perp\operatorname{Obj}D[i]$.
Definition 4.1.4. 1. A class ${\tilde{\mathcal{P}}}\subset\operatorname{Obj}\underline{C}$ will be called strongly extension-closed if it contains $0$ and for any $\phi_{i}:Y_{i}\to Y_{i+1}$ such that $Y_{0}\in{\tilde{\mathcal{P}}}$ and $\operatorname{\operatorname{Cone}}(\phi_{i})\in{\tilde{\mathcal{P}}}$ for all $i\geq 0$ we have $\operatorname{\varinjlim}_{i\geq 0}Y_{i}\in{\tilde{\mathcal{P}}}$ (i.e. ${\tilde{\mathcal{P}}}$ contains all possible cones of the corresponding distinguished triangle; note that these are isomorphic). 2. The smallest strongly extension-closed Karoubi-closed class of objects of $\underline{C}$ that contains a class $\mathcal{P}\subset\operatorname{Obj}\underline{C}$ and is closed with respect to arbitrary (small) coproducts will be called the strong extension-closure of $\mathcal{P}$. 3. We will denote the closure of $\mathcal{P}$ with respect to $\underline{C}$-coproducts by $\coprod\mathcal{P}$ (in §4.3 below we will also use this notation for the full subcategory of $\underline{C}$ formed by these objects). Also, we will call the class of the objects of $\underline{C}$ that may be presented as homotopy limits of $Y_{i}$ with $Y_{0}$ and $\operatorname{\operatorname{Cone}}(\phi_{i})\in\coprod\mathcal{P}$ the naive big hull of $\mathcal{P}$. We will call the Karoubi-closure of the naive big hull of the class $\mathcal{P}$ its big hull.
Definition 2.2.1. Let $M\in\operatorname{Obj}\underline{C}$. 1. A datum consisting of $M_{\leq i}\in\operatorname{Obj}\underline{C}$, $h_{i}\in\underline{C}(M_{\leq i},M)$, $j_{i}\in\underline{C}(M_{\leq i},M_{\leq i+1})$ for $i$ running through integers will be called a filtration on $M$ if we have $h_{i+1}\circ j_{i}=h_{i}$ for all $i\in{\mathbb{Z}}$. We will denote this filtration by ${\operatorname{Fil}}_{*}M$. A filtration will be called bounded if there exist $l\leq m\in{\mathbb{Z}}$ such that $M_{\leq i}=0$ for all $i<l$ and $h_{i}$ are isomorphisms for all $i\geq m$. 2. A filtration as above equipped with distinguished triangles $M_{\leq i-1}\stackrel{{\scriptstyle j_{i-1}}}{{\to}}M_{\leq i}\to M_{i}$ for all $i\in{\mathbb{Z}}$ will be called a Postnikov tower for $M$ or for ${\operatorname{Fil}}_{*}M$. We will denote this tower by $Po_{\operatorname{Fil}}$. We will denote $M_{-p}[p]$ by $M^{p}$; we will call $M^{p}$ the factors of $Po_{\operatorname{Fil}}$. 3. If ${\operatorname{Fil}}_{*}M^{\prime}=(M^{\prime}_{\leq i},h^{\prime}_{i},j_{i})$ is a filtration of $M^{\prime}\in\operatorname{Obj}\underline{C}$ and $g\in\underline{C}(M,M^{\prime})$ then we will call $g$ along with a collection of $g_{\leq i}\in\underline{C}(M_{\leq i},M^{\prime}_{\leq i})$ a morphism of filtrations compatible with $g$ if $g\circ h_{i}=h^{\prime}_{i}\circ g_{\leq i}$ and $j^{\prime}_{i}\circ g_{\leq i}=g_{\leq i+1}\circ j_{i}$ for all $i\in{\mathbb{Z}}$.
Definition 4.4.1. Let $\beta$ be a regular infinite cardinal. 1. We will say that a class ${\tilde{\mathcal{P}}}$ of objects of $\underline{C}$ is $\beta$-coproductive if it is closed with respect to $\underline{C}$-coproducts of less than $\beta$ objects. 2. We will say that a torsion pair $s=(\mathcal{LO}^{\prime},\mathcal{RO}^{\prime})$ for a full triangulated subcategory $\underline{C}^{\prime}$ of $\underline{C}$ is $\beta$-coproductive if both $\operatorname{Obj}\underline{C}^{\prime}$ and $\mathcal{RO}^{\prime}$ are $\beta$-coproductive. 3. We will say that an object $M$ of $\underline{C}$ is $\beta$-compact if it belongs to the maximal perfect class of $\beta$-small objects of $\underline{C}$ (whose existence is given by Proposition 3.3.2(4)). We will denote the full subcategory of $\underline{C}$ formed by $\beta$-compact objects by $\underline{C}^{\beta}$.
Definition 3.1.6. Let $R$ be a associative commutative unital ring, and assume that $\underline{C}$ is $R$-linear. 1. We will say that an $R$-linear cohomological functor $H$ from $\underline{C}$ into $R-\operatorname{Mod}$ is of $R$-finite type whenever for any $M\in\operatorname{Obj}\underline{C}$ the $R$-module $H(M)$ is finitely generated and $H(M[i])=\{0\}$ for almost all $i\in{\mathbb{Z}}$. 2. We will say that $\underline{C}$ is $R$-saturated if the representable functors from $\underline{C}$ are exactly all the $R$-finite type ones.
