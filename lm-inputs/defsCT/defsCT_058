Definition 2.1. A complete lattice is a partially ordered set of which arbitrary subsets have a least upper bound. In a complete lattice every subset also has a greatest lower bound. A locale is a complete lattice that satisfies the following infinitary distributive law: $\bigvee(x\wedge y_{i})=x\wedge\bigvee y_{i}.$ The elements of a locale are called opens. A morphism $K\to L$ of locales is a function $f\colon L\to K$ that satisfies $f(x\wedge y)=f(x)\wedge f(y)$ and $f(\bigvee x_{i})=\bigvee f(x_{i})$. (Note the change in direction!) This forms a category $\mathbf{Loc}$.
Definition 2.8. A presheaf on a locale $L$ is a functor $X\colon L^{\mathrm{op}}\to\mathbf{Sets}$. More concretely, a presheaf consists of a family of sets $(X(p))_{p\in L}$ together with for any $q\leq p$ a restriction operation $(-)\upharpoonright q:X(p)\to X(q)$ satisfying some natural compatibility conditions. A presheaf $X$ is a sheaf when for any family of elements $\{p_{i}\in L\mid i\in I\}$ and $\{x_{i}\in X(p_{i})\mid i\in I\}$ with $x_{i}\upharpoonright p_{i}\wedge p_{j}=x_{j}\upharpoonright p_{i}\wedge p_{j}$ for all $i,j\in I$ there is a unique element $x\in X(\bigvee p_{i})$ with $x\upharpoonright p_{i}=x_{i}$ for every $i\in I$. For any locale $L$ the sheaves on $L$, with natural transformations between them, form a topos $\operatorname{Sh}(L)$. A topos which is equivalent to one of this form is called localic.
Definition 2.3. A locale $L$ is called compact if any subset $S\subseteq L$ whose least upper bound is the top element has a finite subset whose least upper bound is also the top element. If $a$ and $b$ are two elements of a locale $L$, then $a$ is well inside $b$ if $c\wedge a=0$ and $c\vee b=1$ for some $c\in L$. A locale $L$ is called regular if any $a\in L$ is the least upper bound of the elements well inside it.
Definition Remark Let us exclude the trivial case ${\text{Ob}}\,{\Cal{C}}=\{X\mid X{\text{ is }}T_{3}{\text{ and }}|X|\leq 1\}$. Then the underlying set functor $U:{\Cal{C}}\to{\mathbb{Set}}$ has a left adjoint $F$ that has a natural transformation to the functor $X\to\beta(X_{d})$, with all components embeddings ([KS], essentially Step 4, p. 143, applied to $T_{3}$ spaces). Then we can recover a (maximal) class ${\Cal{F}}$, by considering the spaces $FX$, for all $X\in{\text{Ob}}\,{\mathbb{Set}}$: the points of all these spaces $FX$ will give the class of ultrafilters mentioned in Theorem F. (This is the construction of [KS], Step 6, p. 144, except that there fixed ultrafilters are not considered, but that does not change matters). Thus we have for this (maximal) class ${\Cal{F}}$ that for $X\in{\text{Ob}}\,{\mathbb{Set}}$, and for any ${\mathbb{Set}}$-morphism $f:Y\to X$ there exists a domain-codomain extension of $f$ to a ${\mathbb{T_{3}}}$-morphism $Ff:FY\to FX$, i.e., $(Ff)(FY)\subset FX$. In short: “${\Cal{F}}$ is closed under images”. (This is a special case of the statement of Theorem F, 2), B) applied to the space $FX$ rather than $X$ in Theorem F 2) B)). Observe that [KS] Theorem did not contain this property of ${\Cal{F}}$ explicitly. In fact this property is necessary (and sufficient) for $F$ to be a left adjoint of $U$ even when restricted to the minimal class $\{FX\mid X\in{\text{Ob}}\,{\mathbb{Set}}\}$ (Kleisli adjunction, [AHS], 20.39, 20.B). On the other hand, for given ${\Cal{F}}$, the class ${\Cal{C}}$ constructed in Theorem F is a maximal subclass of ${\mathbb{T_{3}}}$ for which $F$ and $\eta$ are left adjoint to $U$ and unit of adjunction. Recall that all subcategories considered are isomorphism closed. Observe also that $F$ and $\eta$ are defined only up to isomorphisms, forming respective commutative diagrams. We can eliminate these ambiguities by using some specific construction of $\beta(X_{d})$, e.g., with ultrafilters, and considering $\eta_{X}X\subset UFX{\text{ and }}FX\subset\beta(X_{d})$ (thus the usual embeddings are realized by embeddings of subsets/subspaces). Let us denote, for given (maximal) ${\Cal{C}}$ and (maximal) ${\Cal{F}}$, by ${\Cal{C}}({\Cal{F}})$ and ${\Cal{F}}({\Cal{C}})$ the (maximal) subcategory ${\Cal{C}}$ constructed for ${\Cal{F}}$ in Theorem F, 2), B) and the (maximal) class ${\Cal{F}}$ constructed in the proof of [KS], Theorem, Step 6. [KS] did not completely clarify the situation. Namely, for a category ${\Cal{C}}$ there exists a class ${\Cal{F}}$ of ultrafilters making 2) B) of Theorem F true. However the questions, which classes ${\Cal{F}}$ of ultrafilters arise this way, and possibly when are the corresponding categories ${\Cal{C}}$ equal, are not considered there. As already mentioned, the class ${\Cal{F}}$ is “closed under images”, so we need to consider this question only for classes of ultrafilters “closed under images”. The class of the spaces $X$ described in Theorem F, 2), B) is the largest class ${\Cal{C}}_{\text{max}}({\Cal{F}})$ (in ${\mathbb{T_{3}}}$!) for which $F$ and $\eta$ are left adjoint to $U$ and unit of adjunction. This ${\Cal{C}}_{\text{max}}({\Cal{F}})$ determines uniquely $F$ and $\eta$ as left adjoint and unit of adjunction, by convention *. Similarly, the class ${\Cal{F}}_{\text{max}}({\Cal{C}})$ gives exactly the Kleisli adjunction (minimal adjunction) associated to the adjunction $F\dashv U$. Beginning with the Kleisli adjunction, then taking the maximal (in ${\mathbb{T_{3}}}$) adjunction with given $F$ and $\eta$, and turning once more to the Kleisli adjunction clearly gives back the original Kleisli adjunction (by *). Beginning with the maximal (in ${\mathbb{T_{3}}}$) adjunction with given $F$ and $\eta$, then taking the Kleisli adjunction, and turning once more to the maximal (in ${\mathbb{T_{3}}}$) adjunction with given $F$ and $\eta$ clearly gives back the original maximal adjunction. This settles the case of maximal subcategories ${\Cal{C}}_{\text{max}}({\Cal{F}})$. It will suffice to prove that under 1) of Theorem F each subcategory ${\Cal{C}}$ is maximal. Observe that the proof of [KS], Theorem, Step 7 in fact proves the following. Let $C\in{\text{Ob}}\,{\Cal{C}}_{\text{max}}({\Cal{F}})$. Then $C\in{\text{Ob}}\,{\Cal{C}}$. (Namely there $C$ is the surjective image of $FUC$, by $\varepsilon_{C}$, the counit of the adjunction.) This proves ${\Cal{C}}_{\text{max}}({\Cal{F}})\subset{\Cal{C}}$, i.e., that each subcategory ${\Cal{C}}$ in 1) of Theorem F is maximal. That is, we have shown the following addition to Theorem F.
Definition Problem 2 There arises the question about the uniform version of Theorem F of Kannan-Soundararajan. That is, we suppose closedness under products, closed subspaces and surjective images. This would be a common generalization of Theorems 2 and 3. As mentioned after Theorem F, Theorems 2 and 3 have a common generalization in Hager [Ha]. However, the description in [Ha] does not seem to imply in an evident way our concrete descriptions in our Theorems 2 and 3. (It uses for the description some class of epimorphisms of the category, of which there are illegitimely many; and it does not seem to be evident how to identify these classes and concretize the description in our concrete cases.) Also, our proofs are independent of [Ha]. However this seems to be a question much more complicated than Theorem F of Kannan-Soundararajan. Let us restrict our attention to the case of ${\mathbb{T_{2}Unif}}$. Of course, we have as examples all $T_{2}$ uniform spaces, whose underlying topological spaces form a class (of Tychonoff spaces!) as described in Theorem F. Moreover, if we take a cardinal $\lambda_{0}\geq\aleph_{0}$, we have an example all those uniform spaces, whose underlying topological spaces form a class as described in Theorem F, and whose covering characters are at most $\lambda_{0}$. (For $\lambda_{0}=\aleph_{0}$ we have examples for proximities.) The problem is again that we cannot identify the class of epimorphisms whose existence is stated in [Ha] and cannot concretize the description in [Ha]. So a concrete, usable description still is missing.
Definition Problem 1 Find a fourth example (if it exists) that is epireflective and closed under extremal epi images, but is not of the form in 2) (the proof in [KS] seems to use, by $\varepsilon_{C}$, both closedness under bijections and extremal epi images).
Definition Problem 3 What remains open, is the following question, that would include Theorems D, E and 4 (for ${\mathbb{Top}}$), and would be an analogue of Theorem 5. Namely, can one describe all subcategories ${\Cal{C}}$ of ${\mathbb{Top}}$, closed under products and closed subspaces, and being algebraic? Are there more such subcategories than described in Theorems D and E? (Observe that the uniform case is settled by Theorem 5. Thus the situation is just the converse of the situation mentioned in Problem 2, where the uniform case seems to be much more complicated.)
Definition 5.1. Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a strict $\mathbf{k}$-linear 2-category, and let $\mathcal{G}$ be the skeletal 2-group classified by the(normalised) 3-cocycle $\alpha:G\times G\times G\longrightarrow\mathbf{k}^{\times}$, as in Example 2.2. We write $\mathrm{2Rep}_{\mathcal{C}}^{\alpha}(G):=\mathrm{Bicat}(\bullet/\!\!/\mathcal{% G},\mathcal{C})$ for the 2-category of 2-representations as in [Bar09, Definition 7.1].3This is not the same as the category $\operatorname{Hom}_{\mathrm{2}\mbox{-}\mathrm{Grp}}(\mathcal{G},\mathrm{Aut}(% \mathcal{C}))$ in [FZ11] after Definition 2.6.
Definition 2.4. Let $\mathcal{G}$ and $\mathcal{H}$ be categorical groups. By a homomorphism from $\mathcal{G}$ to $\mathcal{H}$ we mean a (strong) monoidal functor $\mathcal{G}\longrightarrow\mathcal{H}.$ A linear representation of a categorical group $\mathcal{G}$ with centre $A=\mathbf{k}^{\times}$ is a homomorphism $\varrho:\mathcal{G}\longrightarrow GL(V)$ where $V$ is an object of a strict ($\mathbf{k}$-linear) 2-category, and $\mathbf{k}^{\times}$ is required to act by multiplication with scalars.
Definition 3.14 ([GK08, Definition 4.12]). Let $\varrho$ be a projective 2-representation of a finite group $G$ on a $\mathbf{k}$-linear 2-category. If $g,h\in G$ is a pair of commuting elements, then $\beta_{g,h}$ is an automorphism of $X(g)$. Assuming $\beta_{g,h}$ to be of trace class, we have the joint trace of $g$ and $h$, $\chi(g,h):=tr(\beta_{g,h}).$ If the joint trace is defined for all commuting $g,h\in G$, we refer to $\chi$ as the 2-character of $\varrho$.
Definition 3.11 ([GK08, Definition 3.1] and [Bar09, Definition 7.8]). Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a 2-category, $x\in\mathrm{ob}(\mathcal{C})$ and $A\in\mathrm{1\mbox{-}Hom}_{\mathcal{C}}(x,x)$ a 1-endomorphism of $x$. The categorical trace of $A$ is defined to be $\mathbb{T}\mathrm{r}(A)=\mbox{2-Hom}_{\mathcal{C}}(1_{x},A)$ where $1_{x}$ is the identity 1-morphism of $x$.
Definition 5.3. The induced 2-representation of $W$, if it exists, is characterised by the universal property of a left-adjoint. More precisely, an object $\mathrm{ind}_{H}^{G}W$, together with a projective 2-representation $\mathrm{ind}_{H}^{G}\varrho$ with cocycle $\alpha$ and a 1-morphism $j:\varrho\longrightarrow\mathrm{ind}_{H}^{G}\varrho$ in $\mathrm{2Rep}_{\mathrm{Vect}_{\mathbf{k}}}^{\alpha|_{H}}(H)$ is called induced by $\varrho$, if for any projective $G$-2-representation $\pi$ on $V\in\mathrm{ob}(\mathcal{C})$ with cocycle $\alpha$ and any 1-morphism of projective $H$-2-representations (for $\alpha|_{H}$) $F:\varrho\longrightarrow\pi$ there exists a 1-morphism of projective $G$-2-representations (for $\alpha$) $\bar{F}:\mathrm{ind}_{H}^{G}\varrho\longrightarrow\pi$ and a 2-isomorphism $\Phi$ fitting in the commuting diagram of $H$-maps such that $(\bar{F},\Phi)$ is determined uniquely up to unique 2-isomorphism. Here “unique” means that given two such pairs $(\bar{F_{1}},\Phi_{1})$ and $(\bar{F_{2}},\Phi_{2})$, there is a unique 2-isomorphism $\eta:\bar{F_{1}}\stackrel{{\scriptstyle\cong}}{{\Longrightarrow}}\bar{F_{2}}$ satisfying $(\eta j)\circ\Phi_{1}=\Phi_{2}.$ If it exists, the induced projective 2-representation of $W$ is determined uniquely up to a 1-equivalence in $\mathrm{2Rep}^{\alpha}_{\mathrm{Vect}_{\mathbf{k}}}(G)$, which is unique up to canonical 2-isomorphism.
Definition 3.13 (Compare [GK08, Definition 4.8] and, in particular, [Bar09, Definition 7.9]). Let $\varrho$ be a projective 2-representation of a finite group $G$. The character of $\varrho$ is the assignment $g\longmapsto\mathbb{T}\mathrm{r}(\varrho(g))=:X(g)$ for each $g\in G$, and the collection of isomorphisms $\beta_{g,h}:X(g)\longrightarrow X(hgh^{-1})$ defined in terms of string diagrams for each $g,h\in G$. That the $\beta_{g,h}$ are isomorphisms is a consequence of Theorem 2.
Definition 3.1. Let $G$ be a finite group, and $\mathcal{C}$ a $\mathbf{k}$-linear 2-category. A projective 2-representation of $G$ on $\mathcal{C}$ consists of the following data (a) an object $V$ of $\mathcal{C}$ (b) for each $g\in G$, a 1-automorphism $\varrho(g):V\longrightarrow V$, drawn as (c) for every pair $g,h\in G$, a 2-isomorphism $\psi_{g,h}:\varrho(g)\varrho(h)\stackrel{{\scriptstyle\cong}}{{\Rightarrow}}% \varrho(gh)$, drawn as (d) a 2-isomorphism $\psi_{1}:\varrho(1)\stackrel{{\scriptstyle\cong}}{{\Rightarrow}}\operatorname{% id}_{V}$, drawn as such that the following conditions hold (i) for any $g,h,k\in G$, we have $\psi_{g,hk}(\varrho(g)\psi_{h,k})=\alpha(g,h,k)\psi_{gh,k}(\psi_{g,h}\varrho(k% )),$ where $\alpha(g,h,k)\in\mathbf{k}^{\times}$. In string diagram notation, we draw this as (ii) for any $g\in G$, we have $\psi_{1,g}=\psi_{1}\varrho(g)\mbox{ and }\psi_{g,1}=\varrho(g)\psi_{1}.$ In string diagram notation, we draw these as and
Definition 4.2. We define the inertia 2-groupoid of a categorical group $\mathcal{G}$ as the 2-groupoid $\displaystyle\Lambda\mathcal{G}$ $\displaystyle=$ $\displaystyle\mathrm{Bicat}(\bullet/\!\!/\mathbb{Z},\bullet/\!\!/\mathcal{G}),$ where the integers are viewed as a discrete 2-group (only identity morphisms).
Definition 5.6. The category $\mathbf{ICat}^{S}$ is the left Bousfield localization of $\mathbf{ICat}^{P}$ with respect to the maps $\mathbb{L}SG(n)\to\mathbb{L}SF(n)$.
Definition 2.2. The model category $\mathbf{CSS}$ is the left Bousfield localization of $s\mathbf{S}^{S}$ with respect to the map $\Delta[0]\to NI[1]$.
Definition 6.2. A map $f:U\to V$ in $s\mathbf{S}$ is said to be a Dwyer-Kan equivalence if • The induced map $\operatorname{Ho}(U)\to\operatorname{Ho}(V)$ is essentially surjective. • For each pair $(x,y)$ of $0$-simplices of $U_{0}$, the induced map $\operatorname{map}_{U}(x,y)\to\operatorname{map}_{U}(f(x),f(y))$ is a weak equivalence. A map $f:C\to D$ between Segal fibrant internal category is said to be a Dwyer-Kan equivalence if its nerve is one.
Definition 8.4. Let $F\in\mathbf{S}^{C}$ and $\alpha:C\to D$, then the homotopy left Kan extension of $F$ along $\alpha$ is the left derived functor of $\alpha_{!}$ applied to $F$.
Definition 3.3. The category $\mathbf{ICat}$ is the Grothendieck construction of the pseudo-functor $\mathbf{S}^{\mathrm{op}}\to\mathbf{CAT}$ sending $P$ to $\mathbf{ICat}_{P}$.
Definition 5.9. A Segal space is a Reedy fibrant simplicial space satisfying the Segal condition. A complete Segal space is a Segal space for which the map $X_{0}\to X_{1}^{equiv}$ is a weak equivalence (see [Rez01] for more details).
Definition 2.1. The category $s\mathbf{S}^{S}$ is the left Bousfield localization of $s\mathbf{S}$ with respect to the maps $G(n)\to F(n)$ for any $n\geq 1$.
Definition 5.7. The model category $\mathbf{ICat}$ is the left Bousfield localization of $\mathbf{ICat}^{R}$ with respect to any of the maps $\mathbb{L}S[0]\to\mathbb{L}SNI[1]$.
Definition 3.2. The category of internal $P$-categories is the category of monoids in $\mathbf{Graph}_{P}$. We denote it by $\mathbf{ICat}_{P}$
Definition 6.6. An internal category $C$ such that $\operatorname{Ob}(C)$ is fibrant and such that the source and target maps are fibrations in $\mathbf{S}$ is called a strongly Segal internal category.
Definition 1.1. Let $\mathbf{X}$ be a cocomplete category and $I$ a class of map in $\mathbf{X}$. The $I$-cell complexes are the smallest class of maps in $\mathbf{X}$ containing $I$ and closed under pushout and tranfinite composition. The $I$-fibrations are the maps with the right lifting property against $I$. The $I$-cofibrations are the maps with the left lifting property against the $I$-fibrations.
Definition 6.1. Let $U$ be a fibrant object of $s\mathbf{S}^{S}$. For any two points $x$ and $y$ in $U_{0}$, we define $\operatorname{map}_{U}(x,y)$ to be the homotopy fiber $\operatorname{map}_{U}(x,y)=\operatorname{hofib}_{(x,y)}(U_{1}\stackrel{{% \scriptstyle(d_{0},d_{1})}}{{\longrightarrow}}U_{0}\times U_{0})$
Definition 3.6. We declare a map in $\mathbf{ICat}$ to be a levelwise (resp. Segal, resp. Rezk) equivalence if its nerve is a levelwise (resp. Segal, resp. Rezk) weak equivalence in $s\mathbf{S}$.
Definition. A model category is combinatorial if the underlying category is locally presentable.
Definition. Let $\lambda$ be a regular cardinal. An object $A$ in a category $\mathscr{D}$ is $\lambda$-presentable if it is small with respect to $\lambda$-filtered colimits, i.e. if for every $\lambda$-filtered colimit $\operatorname*{colim}B_{i}$ the map $\operatorname*{colim}\mbox{Hom}(A,B_{i})\to\mbox{Hom}(A,\operatorname*{colim}B% _{i})$ is an isomorphism. We say $A$ is presentable if it is $\lambda$-presentable for some $\lambda$. A cocomplete category is locally presentable if for some regular cardinal $\lambda$ it has a set $S$ of $\lambda$-presentable objects such that every object is a $\lambda$-directed colimit of objects in $S$.
Definition. Assume $\mathscr{C}$ is fibrant, replace fibrantly otherwise. Then $\mathscr{C}_{n}$ is a dg-category with objects given by pairs $(E,\eta)$ where $E$ is a collection $E_{0},\dots,E_{n}\in\textrm{Ob}\mathscr{C}$ and $\eta$ is a collection of $\eta_{I}=\eta(I)\in\mbox{\text@underline{Hom}}_{k-1}(E_{i_{0}},E_{i_{k}})$ for all multi-indices $I=(i_{0},\dots,i_{k})$ with $1\leq k\leq n$. The case $k=0$ is subsumed by the differential on $E$. (We interpret $\eta(i)=0$ where it comes up in computation.) These pairs must satisfy the Maurer–Cartan condition: $\delta\eta+\eta^{2}=0$, explained below. We also demand that all $\eta_{i}\in\mbox{\text@underline{Hom}}(E_{i},E_{i})$ are weak equivalences in $\mathscr{C}$.
Definition A.3. A PIE-limit is a 2-limit that can be constructed as a composite of the following 2-limits: • The product of two categories $\mathscr{X}$ and $\mathscr{Y}$ is the usual cartesian product. Note that it satisfies an enriched universal property: for any category $\mathscr{A}$ the map induced by the projections defines an isomorphism of functor categories $\underline{\mathrm{CAT}}(\mathscr{A},\mathscr{X}\times\mathscr{Y})\cong% \underline{\mathrm{CAT}}(\mathscr{A},\mathscr{X})\times\underline{\mathrm{CAT}% }(\mathscr{A},\mathscr{Y}).$ • The inserter for a parallel pair of functors $f,g\colon\mathscr{X}\to\mathscr{Y}$ is a category $\mathscr{I}$ together with a functor $i\colon\mathscr{I}\to\mathscr{X}$ and a natural transformation $\xymatrix{\mathscr{I}\ar@/^{3}ex/[r]^{fi}\ar@/_{3}ex/[r]_{gi}\ar@{}[r]|{% \Downarrow\alpha}&\mathscr{Y}}$ that is universal with this property. Explicitly, the inserter is the category containing an object for each $x\in\mathscr{X}$ and morphism $fx\to gx$ in $\mathscr{Y}$. Morphisms are maps $x\to x^{\prime}$ in $\mathscr{X}$ that yield commutative ‘naturality’ squares in $\mathscr{Y}$. • The equifier of a parallel pair of natural transformations $\xymatrix{\mathscr{X}\ar@/^{3}ex/[r]^{f}\ar@/_{3}ex/[r]_{g}\ar@{}[r]|{\alpha% \Downarrow\Downarrow\beta}&\mathscr{Y}}$ is a category $\mathscr{E}$ together with a functor $e\colon\mathscr{E}\to\mathscr{X}$ so that $\alpha e=\beta e$ and that is universal with this property. Explicitly, the equifier is the full subcategory $\mathscr{E}\subset\mathscr{X}$ spanned by objects $x\in\mathscr{X}$ for which $\alpha_{x}=\beta_{x}$.
Definition 2.2. By Theorem 1.4, $\mathscr{A}_{c}$ is locally $\lambda$-presentable for some regular cardinal $\lambda$, and, by increasing $\lambda$ if necessary, we may assume that $\lambda$ also satisfies the conditions of Lemma 1.2 (and hence also Lemmas 1.5 and 1.6). Choose a (small) set $\mathscr{P}$ of $\lambda$-presentable objects in $\mathscr{A}_{c}$ such that every object of $\mathscr{A}_{c}$ is a $\lambda$-filtered colimit of objects of $\mathscr{P}$. Let $\operatorname{Hom}_{c}(-,-)$ denote the simplicial enrichment of $\mathscr{A}_{c}$. For any $X\in\mathscr{A}_{c}$ we then define a simplicial object $\mathfrak{B}_{\bullet}(X)$ in $\mathscr{A}_{c}$ with $\mathfrak{B}_{r}(X):=\bigvee_{P_{0},\dots,P_{r}\in\mathscr{P}}X\otimes[% \operatorname{Hom}_{c}(P_{0},P_{1})\times\dots\times\operatorname{Hom}_{c}(P_{% r},X)]$ where the face maps are given by composition in the simplicial category $\mathscr{A}_{c}$ and degeneracy maps are given by the unit maps $*\to\operatorname{Hom}_{c}(P_{i},P_{i})$. This simplicial object is naturally augmented by a map $\mathfrak{B}_{0}(X)\to X$ which therefore induces a natural transformation with components $\eta_{X}:|\mathfrak{B}_{\bullet}(X)|\to X.$
Definition 1.1. Let $\mathscr{A}$ be a cocomplete category. For a regular cardinal $\lambda$, an object $X$ in $\mathscr{A}$ is $\lambda$-presentable if the functor $\mathscr{A}(X,-):\mathscr{A}\to\mathsf{Set}$ preserves colimits of $\lambda$-filtered diagrams1A category $\mathscr{C}$ is $\lambda$-filtered if every subcategory of $\mathscr{C}$ with fewer than $\lambda$ morphisms has a cocone in $\mathscr{C}$. A diagram is $\lambda$-filtered when its indexing category is $\lambda$-filtered.. A category $\mathscr{A}$ is locally $\lambda$-presentable if it is cocomplete and has a (small) set $\mathscr{P}$ of $\lambda$-presentable objects such that every object in $\mathscr{A}$ is isomorphic to a $\lambda$-filtered colimit of objects in $\mathscr{P}$. A category is locally presentable if it is locally $\lambda$-presentable for some regular cardinal $\lambda$. Locally presentable categories are abundant, particularly in ‘algebraic’ or ‘simplicial’ contexts. We refer the reader to [1] for more details.
Definition 3.1. We say that a model category is presentable if it is Quillen equivalent (via a zigzag of Quillen equivalences) to some combinatorial model category. Note that very many familiar model categories are presentable. For example, if one accepts a certain set-theoretic axiom about the existence of large cardinals (Vopěnka’s Principle), then every cofibrantly generated model category is presentable by [14].
Definition 2.1. A morphism $f$ in $\mathscr{A}_{c}$ is a weak equivalence if the underlying morphism $u(f)$ is a weak equivalence in $\mathscr{A}$, and $f$ is a cofibration if $u(f)$ is a cofibration in $\mathscr{A}$.
Definition 2 Let $X$ and $Y$ be in $\mathcal{C}$ where $X$ lives on $a$ and $Y$ on $b$. Then $X$ is conditionally included in $Y$, and we write $X\sqsubseteq Y$, if and only if $a\leq b$ and $X$ is a subsheaf $Y|_{a}$. ${}_{\Box}$
Definition 1 Let $(X_{a})_{a\in\mathcal{A}}$ be a family of sets and $(\gamma_{a})_{a\in\mathcal{A}}$ be a family of surjective functions $\gamma_{a}:X_{1}\to X_{a}$. Then $X=\left(X_{a},\gamma_{a}\right)_{a\in\mathcal{A}}$ is a conditional set on $\mathcal{A}$ if the following properties are satisfied (i) $X_{0}$ is a singleton, (ii) $\gamma_{1}$ is the identity, (iii) $\gamma_{a}(x)=\gamma_{a}(y)$ whenever $\gamma_{b}(x)=\gamma_{b}(y)$, $x,y\in X_{1}$ and $a\leq b$, (iv) for every pairwise disjoint family $\{a_{i}\}\subseteq\mathcal{A}$ with $\vee a_{i}=1$ and $\{x_{i}\}\in\prod X_{a_{i}}$ there exists a unique $x\in X_{1}$ such that $\gamma_{a_{i}}(x)=x_{i}$ for all $i$. ${}_{\Box}$
Definition 3 Let $\{X(i):i\in I\}$ be a nonempty family in $\mathcal{C}$ where $X(i)$ lives on $a_{i}$. Their conditional product is the pointwise product on the infimum of the $\{a_{i}\}$: $\left(\prod_{i\in I}X(i)_{a},(\gamma(i)^{\wedge a_{i}}_{a})_{i\in I}\right)_{a% \in\mathcal{A}_{\wedge a_{i}}}$ Let $X$ live on $a$ and $Y$ on $b$. A conditional function $f:X\to Y$ is a conditional subset $G$ of the conditional product $X\times Y$ such that $G_{c}$ is the graph of a function $f_{c}:X_{c}\to Y_{c}$ for each $c\in\mathcal{A}_{d}$ where $d\leq a\wedge b$. ${}_{\Box}$
Definition 2.2. Given a class of maps $\mathcal{C}$ in $\mathcal{M}$, let $\mathcal{C}\otimes\mathcal{M}$ denote the class of maps $f\otimes id_{X}$ where $f\in\mathcal{C}$ and $X\in\mathcal{M}$. A model category is said to satisfy the monoid axiom if every map in (Trivial-Cofibrations $\otimes\mathcal{M})$-cell is a weak equivalence.
Definition 3.1. A monoidal model category $\mathcal{M}$ is said to satisfy the commutative monoid axiom if whenever $h$ is a trivial cofibration in $\mathcal{M}$ then $h^{\mathbin{\square}n}/\Sigma_{n}$ is a trivial cofibration in $\mathcal{M}$ for all $n>0$.
Definition 1.2 Let $A\!\subseteq\!X^{d}$ be a digraph. (a) A $\underline{coloring}$ of $[X,A]$ is a map $c\!:\!X\!\rightarrow Y$ such that $A\cap(c^{d})^{-1}[\Delta^{d}(Y)]\!=\!\emptyset$. (b) Assume that $X$ is a Polish space. The $\underline{Borel\ chromatic\ number}$ of $[X,A]$ is $\chi_{B}(A)\!:=\!\hbox{\it min}\{\ \hbox{\it Card}(Y)\mid Y\ \hbox{\it is\ a\ % Polish\ space\ and\ there\ is\ a\ Borel\ coloring}\ c\!:\!X\!\rightarrow Y\ % \hbox{\it of}\ [X,A]\ \}.$
Definition 1.1 Let $A\!\subseteq\!X^{d}$. We say that $A$ is a $\underline{digraph}$ if $A\cap\Delta^{d}(X)\!=\!\emptyset$.
Definition 2.2 Let $A\!\subseteq\!X^{d}$. We say that $C\!\subseteq\!X$ is $\underline{A\!-\!discrete}$ if $A\cap C^{d}\!=\!\emptyset$.
Definitions. (1) Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a locally finitely presented Grothendieck category. An object $C\in\mathcal{C}$ is said to be absolutely pure (or $FP$-injective) if $\operatorname{Ext}^{1}_{\mathcal{C}}(X,C)=0$ for any $X\in\operatorname{fp}\mathcal{C}$. An object $C\in\mathcal{C}$ is called $fp$-injective if for any monomorphism $\mu:X\to Y$ in $\operatorname{fp}\mathcal{C}$ the morphism ${}_{\mathcal{C}}(\mu,C)$ is an epimorphism. Evidently that every absolutely pure object is $fp$-injective and every $fp$-injective finitely presented object is absolutely pure. The ring $\mathcal{A}=\{P_{i}\}_{i\in I}$ is right absolutely pure if every right $\mathcal{A}$-module $P\in\mathcal{A}$ is absolutely pure. (2) Let $\operatorname{Mod}{\mathcal{A}}$, $\mathcal{A}=\{P_{i}\}_{i\in I}$, be the category of right $\mathcal{A}$-modules. A module $M\in\operatorname{Mod}{\mathcal{A}}$ is flat if the tensor functor ${M\otimes_{\mathcal{A}}-}$ is exact. $M$ is called $fp$-flat if for any monomorphism $\mu:{}_{\mathcal{A}}K\to{}_{\mathcal{A}}L$ in $\operatorname{mod}{\mathcal{A}^{\text{\rm op}}}$ the morphism ${M\otimes_{\mathcal{A}}\mu}$ is a monomorphism. Evidently that every flat module is $fp$-flat.
Definition 2.3 A finite category $\mathbf{A}$ has series Euler characteristic if $f_{\mathbf{A}}(-1)\in\mathbb{Q}$. In that case, its series Euler characteristic is $\chi_{\Sigma}(\mathbf{A})=f_{\mathbf{A}}(-1)$.
Definition 3.2. Let $H$ be a (left–) bicoalgebroid over $C$. A Yetter–Drinfel’d module over $H$ is a triple $\langle Z,\triangleleft,\delta\rangle$ such that the $C$–bicomodule $Z$ is simultaneously a right $H$–module with $\triangleleft:Z\,\square_{C}\,H\to Z$ and a left $H$–comodule with $\delta:Z\to H\,\square_{C^{e}}\,Z$ so that the action and coaction satisfy the compatibility condition $d^{\langle-1\rangle}h_{[1]}\,\square_{C}\,d^{\langle 0\rangle}\triangleleft h_% {[2]}=h_{[2]}(d\triangleleft h_{[1]})^{\langle-1\rangle}\,\square_{C}\,(d% \triangleleft h_{[1]})^{\langle 0\rangle}$
Definition 4.5. An opmonoidal comonad $\langle\langle G,G_{X,Y},G^{0}\rangle,\Delta,\varepsilon\rangle$ on a monoidal category $\langle\mathcal{C},\,\square\,,\iota\rangle$ consists of • An opmonoidal endofunctor $\langle G,G_{X,Y},G^{0}\rangle$ on $\mathsf{M}$ and • a comonad $\langle G,\Delta,\varepsilon\rangle$ such that $\Delta$ and $\varepsilon$ are opmonoidal
Definition 2.1. A left bicoalgebroid $\langle H,\Delta,\varepsilon,\mu,\eta,\alpha,\beta,C\rangle$ consists of • a $k$–coalgebra $\langle H,\Delta_{H},\varepsilon_{H}\rangle$ • two coalgebra maps $\alpha:H\to C$ and $\beta:H\to C_{cop}$, such that $\alpha$ and $\beta$ ’cocommute’, i.e. $\alpha(h_{(1)})\otimes\beta(h_{(2)})=\alpha(h_{(2)})\otimes\beta(h_{(1)})$. These maps furnish $H$ with a ($C\otimes C$)–bicomodule structure, such that $(H;\lambda_{L},\lambda_{R};\rho_{L},\rho_{R})\in{{}^{C\otimes C}\mathsf{M}^{C% \otimes C}}$. The four $C$–coactions are: $\displaystyle\lambda_{L}(h)$ $\displaystyle=\alpha(h_{(1)})\otimes h_{(2)}\,,\;\;\rho_{L}(h)=h_{(2)}\otimes% \beta(h_{(1)})$ $\displaystyle\lambda_{R}(h)$ $\displaystyle=\beta(h_{(2)})\otimes h_{(1)}\,,\;\;\rho_{R}(h)=h_{(1)}\otimes% \alpha(h_{(2)})$ • $C$–bicomodule maps $\mu_{H}:H\,\square_{C}\,H\to H$ and $\eta_{H}:C\to H$ (multiplication & unit) making $(H,\lambda_{L},\rho_{L})$ an algebra in ${{}^{C}\mathsf{M}^{C}}$, subject to the following axioms: (1) The multiplication map $\mu:H\,\square_{C}\,H\to H$ satisfies: $\sum_{i}\mu(g^{i}\otimes h^{i}_{(1)})\otimes\alpha(h^{i}_{(2)})=\mu(g^{i}_{(1)% }\otimes h^{i})\otimes\beta(g^{i}_{(2)})$ (2) and it is comultiplicative: $\Delta\circ\mu(\sum_{i}g^{i}\otimes h^{i})=\sum_{i}\mu(g^{i}_{(1)}\otimes h^{i% }_{(1)})\otimes\mu(g^{i}_{(2)}\otimes h^{i}_{(2)})$ (3) Furthermore, the product is counital (note that this axiom seems to be missing in Ref. [2]): $\varepsilon(g)\varepsilon(h)=\varepsilon\circ\mu(g\otimes h)$ (4) The unit map $\eta:C\to H$ satisfies the unit axiom: $\mu\circ(\eta\,\square\,H)\circ\lambda_{L}=H=\mu\circ(H\,\square\,\eta)\circ% \rho_{L}$ (5) The unit map is compatible with the coalgebra structure in the following sense: $\Delta(\eta(c))=\eta(c)_{(1)}\otimes\eta(\alpha(\eta(c)_{(2)}))=\eta(c)_{(1)}% \otimes\eta(\beta(\eta(c)_{(2)}))$ $\varepsilon(\eta(c))=\varepsilon(c)$
Definition 2.3. $H\boxtimes H$ is the cocenter of the bicomodule ${}^{C}H\,\square\,H^{C}$, $\xymatrix{H\,\square_{C}\,H\otimes C^{*}\ar[r]^{-}{\Phi_{2}}&H\,\square_{C}\,H% \ar[r]^{-}{\zeta_{2}}&H\boxtimes H}$ where $\Phi_{2}(g^{i}\,\square\,h^{i}\otimes\varphi)=g^{i}\,\square\,h^{i}_{(1)}\,% \varphi(\alpha(h^{i}_{(2)}))-g^{i}_{(1)}\,\square\,h^{i}\,\varphi(\beta(g^{i}_% {(2)}))$
