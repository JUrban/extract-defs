Definition 1.1. We say that a subcategory $\mathcal{C}$ of $\mathcal{T}$ is definable if there is a subset $\Phi$ of $\operatorname*{Mor}(\mathcal{T}^{c})$ such that $\mathcal{C}=\{X\in\mathcal{T}\mid\operatorname*{Hom}{}_{\mathcal{T}}(f,X)\text% { is surjective for all $f\in\Phi$}\}.$
Definition 6.12. Let $R$ be a valuation domain. We say that a sequence $\mathbb{X}=(\mathcal{X}_{n}\mid n\in\mathbb{Z})$ of admissible systems on $\operatorname*{Spec}(R)$ forms an admissible filtration if: (i) $\mathbb{X}$ is a nested sequence, that is, $\mathcal{X}_{n}$ is a nested subsystem of $\mathcal{X}_{n+1}$ for each $n\in\mathbb{Z}$, meaning that for any $\chi\in\mathcal{X}_{n}$ there is $\xi\in\mathcal{X}_{n+1}$ such that $\chi\subseteq\xi$. (ii) (degreewise non-density) For any $n\in\mathbb{Z}$, and for any dense interval $\chi<\xi$ in $\mathcal{X}_{n}$, there is $\mu\in\mathcal{X}_{n+1}$ such that $\chi,\xi\subseteq\mu$.
Definition 4.2. Following [Ba15], we impose the following conditions on a set $\mathcal{X}$ of intervals of $\operatorname*{Spec}(R)$: (i) (disjointness) The system is disjoint, that is, whenever $\chi,\xi\in\mathcal{X}$ are two distinct intervals such that $\operatorname*{\mathfrak{p}}_{\chi}\subseteq\operatorname*{\mathfrak{p}}_{\xi}$ then $\operatorname*{\mathfrak{q}}_{\chi}\subsetneq\operatorname*{\mathfrak{p}}_{\xi}$. In other words, $(\mathcal{X},<)$ is a totally ordered set. (ii) (idempotency) For any $\chi\in\mathcal{X}$ we have $\operatorname*{\mathfrak{p}}_{\chi}=\operatorname*{\mathfrak{p}}_{\chi}^{2}$. (iii) (completeness) For any non-empty subset $\mathcal{Y}\subseteq\mathcal{X}$, there is an interval $\mu\in\mathcal{X}$ such that $\operatorname*{\mathfrak{p}}_{\mu}=\bigcup_{\chi\in\mathcal{Y}}\operatorname*{% \mathfrak{p}}_{\chi}$, and there is an interval $\nu\in\mathcal{X}$ such that $\operatorname*{\mathfrak{q}}_{\nu}=\bigcap_{\chi\in\mathcal{Y}}\operatorname*{% \mathfrak{q}}_{\chi}$. Let us call a system of intervals satisfying these conditions an admissible system.
Definition 2.1. A $(\mathcal{U},\mathcal{V})$ t-structure in a triangulated category $\mathcal{T}$ is called non-degenerate provided that $\bigcap_{n\in\mathbb{Z}}\mathcal{U}[n]=0$ and $\bigcap_{n\in\mathbb{Z}}\mathcal{V}[n]=0$.
Definition 1.2. A triangle $X\xrightarrow{f}Y\xrightarrow{g}Z\rightarrow X[1]$ in $\mathcal{T}$ is a pure triangle if the induced sequence $0\rightarrow\mathbf{y}(X)\xrightarrow{\mathbf{y}(f)}\mathbf{y}(Y)\xrightarrow{% \mathbf{y}(g)}\mathbf{y}(Z)\rightarrow 0$ is exact in $\operatorname*{Mod-\mathcal{T}^{c}}$. If this is the case, we call $f$ a pure monomorphism and $g$ a pure epimorphism in $\mathcal{T}$. We remark that, of course, pure monomorphisms in $\mathcal{T}$ will usually not be monomorphisms in the categorical sense, and the same is the case with pure epimorphisms. Moreover, we call an object $E\in\mathcal{T}$ pure-injective if any pure monomorphism $E\rightarrow X$ in $\mathcal{T}$ splits.
Definition 1.4. We say that a subcategory $\mathcal{C}$ of $\mathcal{T}$ is • closed under directed homotopy colimits if for any directed small category $I$ and any coherent diagram $\mathscr{X}\in\mathbb{D}(I)$ such that $\mathscr{X}_{i}\in\mathcal{C}$ for all $i\in I$ we have $\operatorname*{hocolim}_{i\in I}\mathscr{X}\in\mathcal{C}$, • closed under pure monomorphisms if for any pure monomorphism $Y\rightarrow X$ such that $X\in\mathcal{C}$ we have $Y\in\mathcal{C}$. Following [SŠV17], we call a t-structure $(\mathcal{U},\mathcal{V})$ homotopically smashing if the coaisle $\mathcal{V}$ is closed under directed homotopy colimits. We point out here that any aisle is closed under arbitrary homotopy colimits, and any coaisle is closed under arbitrary homotopy limits, this is [SŠV17, Proposition 4.2].
Definition 3.2. Let $\mathcal{V}$ be a subcategory of $\operatorname*{\mathbf{D}}(R)$. We say that the subcategory $\mathcal{V}$ is determined on cohomology if the following equivalence holds for each $X\in\operatorname*{\mathbf{D}}(R)$: $X\in\mathcal{V}\iff H^{n}(X)[-n]\in\mathcal{V}~{}\forall n\in\mathbb{Z}.$
Definition 2. Suppose we are given a category ${\mathscr{C}}$. Two Lawvere metrics $\text{\rm Length}_{1}$ and $\text{\rm Length}_{2}$ are declared equivalent if, for any real number $\varepsilon>0$, there exists a number $\delta>0$ such that $\begin{array}[]{ccc}\{\text{\rm Length}_{1}(a\rightarrow b)<\delta\}&\quad% \Longrightarrow&\{\text{\rm Length}_{2}(a\rightarrow b)<\varepsilon\}\ ,\\ \{\text{\rm Length}_{2}(a\rightarrow b)<\delta\}&\quad\Longrightarrow&\{\text{% \rm Length}_{1}(a\rightarrow b)<\varepsilon\}\ .\end{array}$
Definition 4. Let ${\mathscr{C}}$ be a category with a metric. Let $Y:{\mathscr{C}}\longrightarrow{\mathop{\rm Hom}}[{\mathscr{C}}^{\hbox{\rm\tiny op% }},\text{\rm Set}]$ be the Yoneda functor, that is the functor sending an object $c\in{\mathscr{C}}$ to the representable functor $Y(c)={\mathop{\rm Hom}}(-,c)$. (i) Let $\mathfrak{L}^{\prime}({\mathscr{C}})$ be the completion of ${\mathscr{C}}$, meaning the full subcategory of ${\mathop{\rm Hom}}[{\mathscr{C}}^{\hbox{\rm\tiny op}},\text{\rm Set}]$ whose objects are the colimits in ${\mathop{\rm Hom}}[{\mathscr{C}}^{\hbox{\rm\tiny op}},\text{\rm Set}]$ of Cauchy seqences in ${\mathscr{C}}$. (ii) Let $\mathfrak{C}^{\prime}({\mathscr{C}})$ be the full subcategory of ${\mathop{\rm Hom}}[{\mathscr{C}}^{\hbox{\rm\tiny op}},\text{\rm Set}]$ whose objects we will call compactly supported. An object $F\in{\mathop{\rm Hom}}[{\mathscr{C}}^{\hbox{\rm\tiny op}},\text{\rm Set}]$, that is a functor $F:{\mathscr{C}}^{\hbox{\rm\tiny op}}\longrightarrow\text{\rm Set}$, is declared to be compactly supported if it takes sufficiently short morphisms to isomorphisms. That is: $F$ belongs to $\mathfrak{C}^{\prime}({\mathscr{C}})$ if there exists an $\varepsilon>0$ such that $\{\text{\rm Length}(a\rightarrow b)<\varepsilon\}\quad\Longrightarrow\quad\{F(% b)\longrightarrow F(a)\text{ is an isomorphism}\}.$ (iii) Now let $\mathfrak{S}^{\prime}({\mathscr{C}})=\mathfrak{C}^{\prime}({\mathscr{C}})\cap% \mathfrak{L}^{\prime}({\mathscr{C}})$.
Definition 17. Let ${\mathscr{S}}$ be a triangulated category with a good metric. Suppose we are given a fully faithful triangulated functor $F:{\mathscr{S}}\longrightarrow{\mathscr{T}}$; we consider also the functor ${\mathscr{Y}}:{\mathscr{T}}\longrightarrow\text{\rm Mod--}{\mathscr{S}}$, which takes an object $A\in{\mathscr{T}}$ to the functor ${\mathop{\rm Hom}}\big{(}F(-),A\big{)}$. The functor $F$ is called a good extension with respect to the metric if ${\mathscr{T}}$ has countable coproducts, and for every Cauchy sequence $E_{*}$ in ${\mathscr{S}}$ the natural map ${\displaystyle\mathop{\rm colim}_{\displaystyle\longrightarrow}}\,\widetilde{Y% }(E_{*})\longrightarrow{\mathscr{Y}}\big{(}\begin{picture}(40.0,10.0)\put(20.0% ,0.0){\makebox(0.0,0.0)[b]{\text{\rm Hocolim}}} \put(5.0,-2.0){\vector(1,0){30.0}} \end{picture}\,\,F(E_{*})\big{)}$ is an isomorphism.
Definition 10. Let ${\mathscr{S}}$ be a triangulated category. A good metric on ${\mathscr{S}}$ is a sequence of full subcategories $\{B_{n},\,n\in\mathbb{N}\}$, containing $0$ and with $B_{1}={\mathscr{S}}$, and furthermore satisfying (i) $B_{n}*B_{n}=B_{n}$, which means that if there exists a triangle $b\longrightarrow x\longrightarrow b^{\prime}$ with $b,b^{\prime}\in B_{n}$, then $x\in B_{n}$. (ii) $\Sigma^{-1}B_{n+1}\cup B_{n+1}\cup\Sigma B_{n+1}\subset B_{n}$.
Definition 3. Let ${\mathscr{C}}$ be a category with a Lawvere metric. A Cauchy sequence in ${\mathscr{C}}$ is a sequence $E_{1}\longrightarrow E_{2}\longrightarrow E_{3}\longrightarrow\cdots$ of composable morphisms in which the maps $E_{i}\longrightarrow E_{j}$ eventually become very short. More precisely: for any $\varepsilon>0$ there exists an $M>0$ such that the morphisms $E_{i}\longrightarrow E_{j}$ satisfy $\text{\rm Length}(E_{i}\rightarrow E_{j})\quad<\quad\varepsilon$ whenever $i,j>M$ and $i\leq j$.
Definition 13. Let ${\mathscr{S}}$ be a triangulated category with a good metric. With the category $\mathfrak{S}({\mathscr{S}})$ as in Definition 5(iii), we define the distinguished triangles in $\mathfrak{S}({\mathscr{S}})$ to be the colimits in $\mathfrak{S}({\mathscr{S}})\subset\text{\rm Mod--}{\mathscr{S}}$ of Cauchy sequences of distinguished triangles in ${\mathscr{S}}$.
Definition 5. Let ${\mathscr{C}}$ be a pre-additive category with a metric. Then (i) Let $\mathfrak{L}({\mathscr{C}})$ be the completion of $\widetilde{Y}({\mathscr{C}})$ in $\text{\rm Mod--}{\mathscr{C}}$; it is the full subcategory of $\text{\rm Mod--}{\mathscr{C}}$ whose objects are the colimits in $\text{\rm Mod--}{\mathscr{C}}$ of Cauchy sequences in ${\mathscr{C}}$. (ii) Let $\mathfrak{C}({\mathscr{C}})=\Phi^{-1}\mathfrak{C}^{\prime}({\mathscr{C}})$. (iii) Finally let $\mathfrak{S}({\mathscr{C}})=\mathfrak{C}({\mathscr{C}})\cap\mathfrak{L}({% \mathscr{C}})$.
Definition 19. Suppose ${\mathscr{S}}$ is a triangulated category with a good metric, and let $F:{\mathscr{S}}\longrightarrow{\mathscr{T}}$ be a good extension. We define (i) The full subcategory $\widehat{\mathfrak{L}}({\mathscr{S}})\subset{\mathscr{T}}$ has for objects all the homotopy colimits of Cauchy sequences in ${\mathscr{S}}$. (ii) The full subcategory $\widehat{\mathfrak{S}}({\mathscr{S}})\subset{\mathscr{T}}$ is given by the formula $\widehat{\mathfrak{S}}({\mathscr{S}})=\widehat{\mathfrak{L}}({\mathscr{S}})% \cap{\mathscr{Y}}^{-1}\big{(}\mathfrak{C}({\mathscr{S}})\big{)}$, with $\mathfrak{C}({\mathscr{S}})\subset\text{\rm Mod--}{\mathscr{S}}$ as in Definition 5(ii).
Definition 1. Let $A$ and $B$ be finite sets, and let $G=\operatorname{Sym}(A\times B)$. Define the coLumn group of $G$ as $G_{L}=\{g\in G\;|\;\forall(a,b)\in A\times B:\exists c\in B:g(a,b)=(c,b)\}$ and define the Row group $G_{R}$ symmetrically.
Definition 2. When $G=\mathrm{Aut}(A\times B)$ is an automorphism group, for $w\in\{L,R\}^{*}$, write $G_{w}=G_{w_{1}}G_{w_{2}}\cdots G_{w_{|w|}}$.
Definition 4. [20, Def. 5] [10, Def. 5] For every vertical line $r$, with equation $u=k$, let us identify $r$ with the pair $(k,+\infty)$ and define its multiplicity for $\lambda_{(X,f)}$ to be the number $\mu(r)$ equal to the minimum, over all real $\alpha,v$ with $\alpha>0\ \ k+\alpha<v$, of $\lambda_{(X,f)}(k+\alpha,v)-\lambda_{(X,f)}(k-\alpha,v)$ We shall call any $r$ with positive multiplicity a cornerpoint at infinity.
Definition 14. Let $(\mathbf{C},\cal{U})$ be a concrete category with canonical subobjects. We say that a family $\cal{F}$ of monomorphisms in $\mathbf{C}$ is canonical subobject-invariant if: • for each monomorphism $\phi\in\cal{F}$, pullbacks of $\phi$ along canonical subobject inclusions are also in $\cal{F}$ • for each $X\in\textnormal{Obj}(\mathbf{C})$, the identity morphism of $X$ belongs to $\cal{F}$
Definition 8. A coherent sampling ${\cal V}$ on $(\textnormal{{C}},{\cal U})$ is the assignment to each $X\in\textnormal{Obj}(\textnormal{{C}})$ of a set ${\cal V}(X)$ of subsets of ${\cal U}(X)$, such that the following conditions 1 and 2 hold; it will be said to be a stable coherent sampling if also condition 3 holds: 1. ${\cal V}(X)$ is a finite (possibly empty) set of elements of ${\cal U}(\textnormal{{C}}_{X})$; 2. if $X_{1}\subseteq X_{2}$, then each element of ${\cal V}(X_{1})$ is contained in exactly one element of ${\cal V}(X_{2})$; 3. if $\psi:X\to Y$ is a C-isomorphism, then ${\cal V}(Y)=\Big{(}{\cal U}(\psi)\Big{)}\big{(}{\cal V}(X)\big{)}$.
Definition 18. Given a full subcategory $\mathbf{I}\subseteq\mathbf{C}$ that contains the initial object of $\mathbf{C}$ and is closed under canonical subobjects, we say that a monomorphism $D\hookrightarrow C\in\textnormal{Morph}(\mathbf{C})$ is a deletion with respect to $\mathbf{I}$ if it is a coproduct inclusion $D\hookrightarrow D\cup E$ with $E\in\textnormal{Obj}(\mathbf{I})$. If $E$ is not initial we say the deletion is strict.
Definition 10. Given a weighted graph $(G,f)$, we call persistent block number the function $bl_{(G,f)}:\Delta^{+}\to\mathbb{Z}$ which maps the pair $(u,v)$ to the number of blocks of ${\cal U}^{-1}\big{(}f^{-1}(-\infty,v]\big{)}$ containing at least one block of ${\cal U}^{-1}\big{(}f^{-1}(-\infty,u]\big{)}$.
Definition 16. A non-initial object $C\in\textnormal{Obj}(\mathbf{C})$ is said to be irreducible if whenever we have a monomorphism $A\hookrightarrow C$, either $A$ is initial or $A\hookrightarrow C$ is an isomorphism. We consider the initial object to not be irreducible.
Definition 6. Given the persistence diagrams $D(f),D(g)$ of $\lambda_{(X,f)},\lambda_{(Y,g)}$ respectively, let $\Gamma$ be the set of all bijections between the multisets $D(f)$ and $D(g)$. We define the bottleneck (formerly matching) distance as the real number $d(D(f),D(g))=\inf_{\gamma\in\Gamma}\sup_{p\in D(f)}\|p-\gamma(p)\|_{\infty}$
Definition 1. We say that a concrete category $(\textbf{C},{\cal U})$ has canonical subobjects if the following three conditions are verified: 1. $\mathbf{C}$ has pullbacks and the functor ${\cal U}$ preserves pullbacks. 2. for every object $X\in\textbf{C}$ and for every subset $Z\subseteq{\cal U}(X)$, if there is a subobject $T\xhookrightarrow{\chi}X$ such that $Z={\cal U}(\chi)({\cal U}(T))$ then the category ${\textbf{C}_{X}}{\restriction_{Z}}$ has a terminal object $U\xhookrightarrow{\upsilon}X$. We call such $U\xhookrightarrow{\upsilon}X$ a canonical subobject associated to $Z$, denoted by ${\cal U}^{-1}(X)$. 3. every morphism $Y\xrightarrow{\chi}X$ can be factored as $Y\xrightarrow{\phi}W\xhookrightarrow{\psi}X$ where $\psi$ is a monomorphism and $\mathcal{U}(\psi)(\mathcal{U}(W))=\mathcal{U}(\chi)(\mathcal{U}(Y))$, or equivalently ${\cal U}(\phi)$ is surjective. If $\psi$ is canonical, we will call the pair of morphisms $Y\xrightarrow{\phi}W\xhookrightarrow{\psi}X$ a canonical factorization of $\chi$.
Definition 2. All functions $\lambda_{(X,f)}:\Delta^{+}\to\mathbb{Z}$ are said to be persistence functions if the following conditions 1 and 2 hold; $\lambda$ is said to be stable if the ranges of the filtering functions $f$ are all contained in an interval $[m,M]$ and also condition 3 holds: 1. $\lambda_{(X,f)}(u,v)$ is nondecreasing in $u$ and nonincreasing in $v$; 2. for all $u_{1},u_{2},v_{1},v_{2}\in\mathbb{R}$ such that $u_{1}\leq u_{2}<v_{1}\leq v_{2}$ the following inequality holds: $\lambda_{(X,f)}(u_{2},v_{1})-\lambda_{(X,f)}(u_{1},v_{1})\geq\lambda_{(X,f)}(u% _{2},v_{2})-\lambda_{(X,f)}(u_{1},v_{2})$ 3. given an analogous pair $(Y,g)$, if a C-isomorphism $\psi:X\to Y$ exists such that $\sup_{p\in{\cal U}(X)}|f(p)-g\big{(}({\cal U}(\psi))(p)\big{)}|\leq h$ ($h>0$), then for all $(u,v)\in\Delta^{+}$ the inequality $\lambda_{(X,f)}(u-h,v+h)\leq\lambda_{(Y,g)}(u,v)$ holds.
Definition 12. Given a weighted graph $(G,f)$, for each integer $k\geq 2$ we call persistent $k$-clique community number the function $cc^{k}_{(G,f)}:\Delta^{+}\to\mathbb{Z}$ which maps the pair $(u,v)$ to the number of $k$-clique communities of ${\cal U}^{-1}\big{(}f^{-1}(-\infty,v]\big{)}$ containing at least one $k$-clique community of ${\cal U}^{-1}\big{(}f^{-1}(-\infty,u]\big{)}$.
Definition 19. Given $F\in\textnormal{Fun}(\mathbf{D},\mathbf{C})$ and $d\in\textnormal{Obj}(\mathbf{D})$ and a canonical subobject $G\xhookrightarrow{\phi}F$, we say $\phi$ is a $d$-deletion with respect to $\mathbf{I}\subseteq\mathbf{C}$ if the following conditions are met: • $G(d)\xhookrightarrow{\phi_{d}}F(d)$ is a deletion with respect to $\mathbf{I}$ • Given a canonical subobject $H\xhookrightarrow{\psi}F$, if $\psi_{d}$ factors via $\phi_{d}$ then $\psi$ factors via $\phi$: in other words $\phi$ is maximal given the image in $F(d)$.
Definition 9. We call $A\subseteq{\cal U}(X)$ a steady $F$-set (or simply an s-$F$-set) at $(u,v)$ ($(u,v)\in\Delta^{+}$) if it is an $F$-set at all levels $w$ with $u\leq w<v$. We call $A$ a ranging $F$-set (or simply an r-$F$-set) at $(u,v)$ if there exist levels $w\leq u$ and $w^{\prime}\geq v$ at which it is an $F$-set. Let $SF_{(X,f)}(u,v)$ be the set of s-$F$-sets at $(u,v)$ and let $RF_{(X,f)}(u,v)$ be the set of r-$F$-sets at $(u,v)$.
Definition 15. Let $(\mathbf{C},\cal{U})$ be a concrete category that has canonical subobjects, and is extensive. Let $\cal{F}$ be a canonical subobject-invariant family of monomorphisms in $\mathbf{C}$. An object $X$ is $\cal{F}$-connected if all subobjects $Y\xhookrightarrow{\phi}X$, where the inclusion $\phi$ belongs to $\cal{F}$, are connected. Given an object $C\in\textnormal{Obj}(\mathbf{C})$, we say that an $\cal{F}$-connected component of $C$ is a maximal canonical subobject $X\hookrightarrow C$ such that $X$ is $\cal{F}$-connected.
Definition 5. The persistence diagram of $\lambda_{(X,f)}$ is the multiset of its cornerpoints (proper and at infinity), each repeated as many times as its multiplicity, together with all points of the diagonal $\Delta$, each counted with infinite ($\aleph_{0}$) multiplicity. For the sake of simplicity it will just be denoted by $D(f)$.
Definition 13. Given any real number $w$, the set of vertices $A$ is a $Eu$-set at level $w$ if it is a $Eu$-set of the subgraph $G_{w}$. It is a steady $Eu$-set (an s-$Eu$-set) at $(u,v)$ ($(u,v)\in\Delta^{+}$) if it is a $Eu$-set at all levels $w$ with $u\leq w<v$. It is a ranging $Eu$-set (an r-$Eu$-set) at $(u,v)$ if there exist levels $w\leq u$ and $w^{\prime}\geq v$ at which it is a $Eu$-set. $SEu_{(G,f)}(u,v)$ and $REu_{(G,f)}(u,v)$ are respectively the sets of s-$Eu$-sets and of r-$Eu$-sets at $(u,v)$.
Definition 7. The natural pseudodistance of $(X,f)$ and $(Y,g)$ is $\delta\big{(}(X,f),(Y,g)\big{)}=\left\{\begin{array}[]{l l}+\infty&\textnormal% {if}\ \ \ H=\emptyset\\ \inf_{\phi\in H}\sup_{p\in{\cal U}(X)}|f(p)-g\big{(}\phi(p)\big{)}|&% \textnormal{otherwise}\end{array}\right.$
Definition 17. For a given category $\mathbf{C}$ there are at least three examples of full subcategories closed under canonical subobjects that hence can be used to define three a priori distinct notions of generalized connectedness: • $Irreducible(\mathbf{C})$ spanned by objects that are either irreducible or initial. • $Extrema(\mathbf{C})\subseteq Irreducible(\mathbf{C})$ spanned by either initial or terminal objects. • $Initial(\mathbf{C})\subseteq Extrema(\mathbf{C})$ spanned by initial objects.
Definition 11. Given a weighted graph $(G,f)$, we call persistent edge-block number the function $ebl_{(G,f)}:\Delta^{+}\to\mathbb{Z}$ which maps the pair $(u,v)$ to the number of edge-blocks of ${\cal U}^{-1}\big{(}f^{-1}(-\infty,v]\big{)}$ containing at least one edge-block of ${\cal U}^{-1}\big{(}f^{-1}(-\infty,u]\big{)}$.
Definition 3. [20, Def. 4] [10, Def. 4] For every point $p=(u,v)\in\Delta^{+}$ we define the multiplicity of $p$ for $\lambda_{(X,f)}$ to be the number $\mu(p)$ equal to the minimum, over all positive real $\alpha,\ \beta$ with $u+\alpha<v-\beta$, of $\lambda_{(X,f)}(u+\alpha,v-\beta)-\lambda_{(X,f)}(u-\alpha,v-\beta)-\lambda_{(% X,f)}(u+\alpha,v+\beta)+\lambda_{(X,f)}(u-\alpha,v+\beta)$ We shall call any $p\in\Delta^{+}$ with positive multiplicity a proper cornerpoint.
Definition 6.3. Let $\mathcal{D}_{H}$ be a left $H$-category, $M$ be a right-left SAYD module over $H$ and let $r\in\mathbb{N}$. Then, for each $n\geq 0$, we define a $k$-linear trace map $tr^{M}:M\otimes CN_{n}\left(\mathcal{D}_{H}\otimes M_{r}(k)\right)% \longrightarrow M\otimes CN_{n}(\mathcal{D}_{H})$ $tr^{M}\left(m\otimes(f^{0}\otimes B^{0})\otimes\ldots\otimes(f^{n}\otimes B^{n% })\right):=(m\otimes f^{0}\otimes\ldots\otimes f^{n})\text{trace}(B^{0}\ldots B% ^{n})$ for any $m\in M$ and $(f^{0}\otimes B^{0})\otimes\ldots\otimes(f^{n}\otimes B^{n})\in CN_{n}\left(% \mathcal{D}_{H}\otimes M_{r}(k)\right)$.
Definition 4.1. Let $\mathcal{D}_{H}$ be a left $H$-category and $C$ be a left $H$-module coalgebra. We say that $C$ acts on $\mathcal{D}_{H}$ if we have $k$-linear maps $\{C\otimes Hom_{\mathcal{D}_{H}}(X,Y)\longrightarrow Hom_{\mathcal{D}_{H}}(X,Y% )\}_{(X,Y)\in Ob(\mathcal{D}_{H})^{2}}$ satisfying $\displaystyle c(gf)=(c_{1}g)(c_{2}f),\quad c(id_{X})=\varepsilon_{C}(c)id_{X},% \quad h(cf)=(hc)f$ for any $f\in Hom_{\mathcal{D}_{H}}(X,Y),~{}g\in Hom_{\mathcal{D}_{H}}(Y,Z),~{}c\in C$ and $h\in H$.
Definition 8.2 (see [kr]). Let $C$ be a left $H$-module coalgebra, $(\Theta,\hat{D})$ be a left DGH-module coalgebra and $M$ be a right-left SAYD module over $H$. An $n$-dimensional $\Theta$-cycle over $C$ is a tuple $(\Theta,\hat{D},\hat{x},\varrho)$ where $\hat{x}$ is an $n$-dimensional closed graded $(H,M)$-cotrace on $\Theta$ and $\varrho:\Theta_{0}\longrightarrow C$ is an $H$-linear coalgebra map.
Definition 5.7. Let $(\mathcal{S}_{H},\hat{\partial}_{H})$ be a left DGH-category and $M$ be a right-left SAYD module. A closed graded $(H,M)$-trace of dimension $n$ on $\mathcal{S}_{H}$ is a collection of $k$-linear maps $\hat{\mathscr{T}}^{H}:=\{\hat{\mathscr{T}}_{X}^{H}:M\otimes Hom^{n}_{\mathcal{% S}_{H}}(X,X)\longrightarrow k\}_{X\in Ob(\mathcal{S}_{H})}$ such that $\displaystyle\hat{\mathscr{T}}_{X}^{H}\big{(}mh_{1}\otimes S(h_{2})f\big{)}=% \varepsilon(h)\hat{\mathscr{T}}_{X}^{H}(m\otimes f)$ $\displaystyle\hat{\mathscr{T}}_{X}^{H}\big{(}m\otimes\hat{\partial}_{H}^{n-1}(% f^{\prime})\big{)}=0$ $\displaystyle\hat{\mathscr{T}}_{X}^{H}\big{(}m\otimes g^{\prime}g)=(-1)^{ij}~{% }\hat{\mathscr{T}}_{Y}^{H}\big{(}m_{(0)}\otimes\left(S^{-1}(m_{(-1)})g\right)g% ^{\prime}\big{)}$ for all $h\in H$, $m\in M$, $f\in Hom^{n}_{\mathcal{S}_{H}}(X,X)$, $f^{\prime}\in Hom^{n-1}_{\mathcal{S}_{H}}(X,X)$, $g\in Hom^{i}_{\mathcal{S}_{H}}(X,Y)$, $g^{\prime}\in Hom^{j}_{\mathcal{S}_{H}}(Y,X)$ and $i+j=n$.
Definition 8.6. (see [kr]) Let $\Theta$ be a left DGH-module coalgebra. A $\Theta$-cycle $(\Theta,\hat{D},\hat{x},\varrho)$ over $C$ is said to be vanishing if there exists a coalgebra morphism $\lambda\in Hom_{H}(\Theta_{0},\Theta_{0})$ and a co-inner automorphism $\Psi\in Hom_{H}(M_{2}(\Theta_{0}),M_{2}(\Theta_{0}))$ such that $\Psi\left(\left[\begin{matrix}\theta&0\\ 0&\lambda(\theta)\end{matrix}\right]\right)=\left[\begin{matrix}0&0\\ 0&\lambda(\theta)\end{matrix}\right]$ for all $\theta\in\Theta_{0}$. In other words, there exists a coalgebra morphism $\lambda\in Hom_{H}(\Theta_{0},\Theta_{0})$ and a convolution invertible map $\chi\in Hom_{H}(M_{2}(\Theta_{0}),k)$ such that $\chi\left(\left[\begin{matrix}\theta_{1}&0\\ 0&\lambda(\theta_{1})\end{matrix}\right]\right)\left[\begin{matrix}\theta_{2}&% 0\\ 0&\lambda(\theta_{2})\end{matrix}\right]\chi^{-1}\left(\left[\begin{matrix}% \theta_{3}&0\\ 0&\lambda(\theta_{3})\end{matrix}\right]\right)=\left[\begin{matrix}0&0\\ 0&\lambda(\theta)\end{matrix}\right]$ for all $\theta\in\Theta_{0}$.
Definition 5.9. Let $(\mathcal{S}_{H},\hat{\partial}_{H})$ be a left DGH-category. An $\mathcal{S}_{H}$-cycle of dimension $n$ with coefficients in a SAYD module $M$ over $H$ is a triple $(\mathcal{S}_{H},\hat{\partial}_{H},\hat{\mathscr{T}}^{H})$ such that $\hat{\mathscr{T}}^{H}$ is a closed graded $(H,M)$-trace of dimension $n$ on $\mathcal{S}_{H}$.
Definition 5.2. A DG-functor $\alpha$ between two DG-categories $(\mathcal{C},\partial)$ and $(\mathcal{C}^{\prime},\partial^{\prime})$ is a $k$-linear functor $\alpha:\mathcal{C}\longrightarrow\mathcal{C}^{\prime}$ such that the induced map $Hom^{\bullet}_{\mathcal{C}}(X,Y)\longrightarrow Hom^{\bullet}_{\mathcal{C}^{% \prime}}(\alpha X,\alpha Y)$, $f\mapsto\alpha(f)$, is a morphism of complexes for each $X,Y\in Ob(\mathcal{C})$ compatible with composition and units.
Definition 7.5. Let $(\mathcal{S}_{H},\hat{\partial}_{H},\hat{\mathscr{T}}^{H})$ be an $n$-dimensional $\mathcal{S}_{H}$-cycle with coefficients in a SAYD module $M$ over $H$ (see, Definition 5.9). Then, we say that the cycle $(\mathcal{S}_{H},\hat{\partial}_{H},\hat{\mathscr{T}}^{H})$ is vanishing if the $H$-category $\mathcal{S}^{0}_{H}$ satisfies the assumption in Proposition 7.3.
Definition 2.1. Let $H$ be a Hopf algebra over a field $k$. A $k$-linear category $\mathcal{D}_{H}$ is said to be a left $H$-module category if (i) $Hom_{\mathcal{D}_{H}}(X,Y)$ is a left $H$-module for all $X,Y\in Ob(\mathcal{D}_{H})$ (ii) $h(\text{id}_{X})=\varepsilon(h)\text{id}_{X}$ for all $X\in Ob(\mathcal{D}_{H})$ and $h\in H$ (iii) the composition map is a morphism of $H$-modules, i.e., $h(gf)=(h_{1}g)(h_{2}f)$ for any $h\in H$, $f\in Hom_{\mathcal{D}_{H}}(X,Y)$ and $g\in Hom_{\mathcal{D}_{H}}(Y,Z)$. A small left $H$-module category will be called a left $H$-category.
Definition 7.1 (see [Sch], p 24). Let $\mathcal{D}_{H}$ be a left $H$-category. An automorphism $\Phi\in Hom_{Cat_{H}}(\mathcal{D}_{H},\mathcal{D}_{H})$ is said to be inner if $\Phi$ is isomorphic to the identity functor $id_{\mathcal{D}_{H}}$. Equivalently, there exist morphisms $\{\eta(X):X\longrightarrow\Phi(X)\}_{X\in Ob(\mathcal{D}_{H})}$ such that $\Phi(f)=\eta(Y)\circ f\circ(\eta(X))^{-1}$ for any $f\in Hom_{\mathcal{D}_{H}}(X,Y)$.
Definition 5.1. A differential graded category (DG-category) $(\mathcal{C},\partial)$ is a $k$-linear category $\mathcal{C}$ such that (i) $Hom^{\bullet}_{\mathcal{C}}(X,Y)=\big{(}Hom^{n}_{\mathcal{C}}(X,Y),\partial^{n% }_{XY}\big{)}_{n\geq 0}$ is a cochain complex of $k$-spaces for each $X,Y\in Ob(\mathcal{C})$. (ii) the composition map $Hom^{\bullet}_{\mathcal{C}}(Y,Z)\otimes Hom^{\bullet}_{\mathcal{C}}(X,Y)% \longrightarrow Hom^{\bullet}_{\mathcal{C}}(X,Z)$ is a morphism of complexes. Equivalently, $\partial^{n}_{XZ}(gf)=\partial^{n-r}_{YZ}(g)f+(-1)^{n-r}g\partial^{r}_{XY}(f)$ for any $f\in Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(X,Y)^{r}$ and $g\in Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(Y,Z)^{n-r}$. Whenever the meaning is clear from context, we will drop the subscript and simply write $\partial^{\bullet}$ for the differential on any $Hom^{\bullet}_{\mathcal{C}}(X,Y)$.
Definition 8.5 (see [CO], Section 3). An automorphism $\Psi:C\longrightarrow C$ of an $H$-module coalgebra $C$ is said to be co-inner if there exists an $H$-linear invertible element $\chi\in C^{*}=Hom_{H}(C,k)$ such that $\Psi=(\chi\otimes id_{C}\otimes\chi^{-1})(\Delta_{C}\otimes id_{C})\Delta_{C}=% (\chi\otimes id_{C}\otimes\chi^{-1})(id_{C}\otimes\Delta_{C})\Delta_{C}$ i.e., $\Psi(c)=\chi(c_{1})c_{2}\chi^{-1}(c_{3})$ for all $c\in C$.
Definition 5.8. Let $(\mathcal{S},\hat{\partial})$ be a DG-category. A closed graded trace of dimension $n$ on $\mathcal{S}$ is a collection of $k$-linear maps $\hat{T}:=\{\hat{T}_{X}:Hom^{n}_{\mathcal{C}}(X,X)\longrightarrow k\}_{X\in Ob(% \mathcal{C})}$ such that $\displaystyle\hat{T}_{X}\left(\hat{\partial}^{n-1}(f)\right)=0$ $\displaystyle\hat{T}_{X}(g^{\prime}g)=(-1)^{ij}~{}\hat{T}_{Y}(gg^{\prime})$ for all $f\in Hom^{n-1}_{\mathcal{S}}(X,X)$, $g\in Hom^{i}_{\mathcal{S}}(X,Y)$, $g^{\prime}\in Hom^{j}_{\mathcal{S}}(Y,X)$ and $i+j=n$.
Definition 3.2. Let $H$ be a Hopf algebra with a bijective antipode $S$. A $k$-vector space $M$ is said to be a right-left anti-Yetter-Drinfeld module over $H$ if $M$ is a right $H$-module and a left $H$-comodule such that $\rho(mh)=(mh)_{(-1)}\otimes(mh)_{(0)}=S(h_{3})m_{(-1)}h_{1}\otimes m_{(0)}h_{2}$ for all $m\in M$ and $h\in H$, where $\rho:M\longrightarrow H\otimes M,~{}m\mapsto m_{(-1)}\otimes m_{(0)}$ is the coaction. Moreover, $M$ is said to be stable if $m_{(0)}m_{(-1)}=m$.
