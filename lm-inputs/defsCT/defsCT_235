Definition 2.3 (Left’s Maintenance). Consider an Absolute Universe $\mathbb{U}$, and let $G,H\in\mathbb{U}$. The Left Provisional Game $[G,H]\in\text{Maintain}(\mathbb{U})\subset\mathbb{U}\times\mathbb{U}$ if, for all Right options $[G,H]^{R}\in[G,H]^{\mathcal{R}}$, there is a Left option $[G,H]^{RL}$, such that $[G,H]^{RL}\in\text{Maintain}(\mathbb{U})$.
Definition 3.19. Let $\mathbb{U}$ be any universe of combinatorial games. For $G,H\in\mathbb{U}$, $G\succcurlyeq H$ modulo $\mathbb{U}$ if and only if $o_{L}(G+X)\geqslant o_{L}(H+X)$ and $o_{R}(G+X)\geqslant o_{R}(H+X)$, for all games $X\in\mathbb{U}$.
Definition 3.11. Consider a totally ordered group $\mathbb{A}$ and $G,H\in(\Omega,\mathbb{A})$. The disjunctive sum of $G$ and $H$ is given by: $\displaystyle G+H$ $\displaystyle=$ $\displaystyle\langle\,\emptyset^{\ell_{1}+\ell_{2}}\mid\emptyset^{r_{1}+r_{2}}% \,\rangle,\quad\textrm{ if $G=\langle\,\emptyset^{\ell_{1}}\mid\emptyset^{r_{1% }}\,\rangle$ and $H=\langle\,\emptyset^{\ell_{2}}\mid\emptyset^{r_{2}}\,\rangle$;}$ $\displaystyle=$ $\displaystyle\langle\,\emptyset^{\ell_{1}+\ell_{2}}\mid{G^{\mathcal{R}}}+H,G+H% ^{\mathcal{R}}\,\rangle,\textrm{ if $G=\langle\,\emptyset^{\ell_{1}}\mid{G^{\mathcal{R}}}\,\rangle$, $H=\langle\,\emptyset^{\ell_{2}}\mid H^{\mathcal{R}}\,\rangle$},$ $\displaystyle\qquad\textrm{ and at least one of ${G^{\mathcal{R}}}$ and $H^{% \mathcal{R}}$ is not empty;}$ $\displaystyle=$ $\displaystyle\langle\,{G^{\mathcal{L}}}+H,G+H^{\mathcal{L}}\mid\emptyset^{r_{1% }+r_{2}}\,\rangle,\textrm{ if $G=\langle\,{G^{\mathcal{L}}}\mid\emptyset^{r_{1}}\,\rangle$, $H=\langle\,{G^{\mathcal{L}}}\mid\emptyset^{r_{2}}\,\rangle$},$ $\displaystyle\qquad\textrm{ and at least one of ${G^{\mathcal{L}}}$ and $H^{% \mathcal{L}}$ is not empty;}$ $\displaystyle=$ $\displaystyle\langle\,{G^{\mathcal{L}}}+H,G+H^{\mathcal{L}}\mid{G^{\mathcal{R}% }}+H,G+H^{\mathcal{R}}\,\rangle,\textrm{ otherwise.}$
Definition 3.3 (Left’s Residual Strategy). Given two maintenance strategies $g\in\mathcal{L}_{R}(J,G)$ and $f\in\mathcal{L}_{R}(H,J)$, we construct Left’s residual strategy $g\circledast f$ as follows. Consider a Right move from $[G,H]$ to $[G^{R},H]$. We will find a Left’s maintenance response, given the candidate morphisms $f$ and $g$. Set up the two games $[G,J]$ and $[J,H]$, corresponding to the maintenance strategies $f$ and $g$ respectively; see the columns of Figure 2. If Left’s maintenance response in $[G^{R},J]$ is to $[G^{RL},J]$, then adapt this maintenance strategy for the game $[G^{R},H]$, as $[G^{RL},H]$. If Left’s maintenance response in $[G^{R},J]$ is to $[G^{R},J^{R}]$ then Left considers instead her maintenance response to the Right move in the game $[J^{R},H]$. If this is $[J^{R},H^{R}]$, then her response in $[G^{R},H]$ is to $[G^{R},H^{R}]$. If, instead, the response is to some $[J^{RL},H]$, she swivels back to the game $[G^{R},J^{RL}]$, and finds a response to this Right move, and so on. In case $[G^{R},J^{R}]$ is a terminal position, then, because $[J^{R},H]$ is a Right’s move in a Left Maintenance Strategy, there must exist a Right move in $H^{R}$, and so the play will terminate in $[G^{R},H^{R}]$, with a Left win (recall the Left Maintenance Game is normal-play). In either case, by continuing this idea, because $J$ is finite and because $f$ and $g$ are maintenance strategies, eventually Left’s response shifts to either of the forms $[G^{RL},J^{\alpha}]$, with $\alpha={RL\ldots L}$ or $[J^{\alpha},H^{R}]$ with $\alpha={RL\ldots R}$ (i.e. $\alpha$ is a finite sequence of alternating moves). In the first case, the response in $[G^{R},H]$ will be to $[G^{RL},H]$ and in the second case it will be to $[G^{R},H^{R}]$. Unless this is a terminal position, we may iterate the argument. The construction of $g\circledast f$ in the case of the Right move $[G,H^{L}]$ is analogous.
Definition 3.15. Let $G\in\mathbb{U}\subseteq\Omega$ and consider given maps $\nu_{L}:\mathbb{A}\rightarrow\mathbb{S}$ and $\nu_{R}:\mathbb{A}\rightarrow\mathbb{S}$, where $S$ is a totally ordered set. The left- and right-outcome functions are $o_{L}:\Omega\rightarrow\mathbb{S},o_{R}:\Omega\rightarrow\mathbb{S}$, where $o_{L}(G)=\begin{cases}\nu_{L}(\ell)&\textrm{if $G=\langle\emptyset^{\ell}\mid{% G^{\mathcal{R}}}\rangle$,}\\ \max_{L}\{o_{R}(G^{L})\}&\textrm{otherwise}\end{cases}$ $o_{R}(G)=\begin{cases}\nu_{R}(r)&\textrm{if $G=\langle{G^{\mathcal{L}}}\mid% \emptyset^{r}\rangle$,}\\ \min_{R}\{o_{L}(G^{R})\}&\textrm{otherwise,}\end{cases}$ where the $\max_{L}$ ($\min_{R}$) ranges over all Left (Right) options.
Definition 3.2. A Left Maintenance Strategy in a given LPG is a play with the following property: consider any stage of the play, where Right is to move; if Right has a move, then Left has a response to this move. We write $\mathcal{L}_{R}(H,G)$ for the set of all Left Maintenance Strategies in the game $[G,H]$, assuming that Right starts, and $\mathcal{L}_{L}(H,G)$ for all Left Maintenance Strategies, assuming that Left starts.
Definition 3.12. A combinatorial game space is the structure $\Omega=((\Omega,\mathbb{A}),\mathbb{S},\nu_{L},\nu_{R},+),$ where ‘+’ is the disjunctive sum in the free space $(\Omega,\mathbb{A})$, $\mathbb{S}$ is a totally ordered set of game results, and $\nu_{L}:\mathbb{A}\rightarrow\mathbb{S}$ and $\nu_{R}:\mathbb{A}\rightarrow\mathbb{S}$ are order preserving maps. Moreover, if $|\mathbb{A}|>1$ then require $\nu(a)=\nu_{L}(a)=\nu_{R}(a)$, for all $a\in\mathbb{A}$.
Definition 3.1. A play in a Left Provisonal Game $X_{0}=[G,H]$ is a chain of positions $X_{0}\leadsto X_{1}\leadsto\cdots\leadsto X_{n}$ where the ‘moves $\leadsto$’ correspond to alternating Left and Right (or Right and Left) moves, and where $n\geqslant 0$.
Definition 3.6 (Mimic strategy). Consider the Left Provisonal Game position $[G,G]$. We define the mimic strategy $m\in\mathcal{L}_{R}(G,G)$ (or copy-cat) as the strategy where Left replies to $[G^{R},G]$ and $[G,G^{L}]$ with $[G^{R},G^{R}]$ and $[G^{L},G^{L}]$ respectively, and repeats this mimic process during the play.
Definition 3.16. A universe $\mathbb{U}$ of combinatorial games is parental if, for each pair of finite non-empty lists, $\mathcal{A},\mathcal{B}\subset\mathbb{U}$, then $\left\langle\mathcal{A}\!\mid\!\mathcal{B}\right\rangle\in\mathbb{U}$.
Definition 2.2 (Left Provisonal Game). Let $\mathbb{U}$ be an Absolute Universe. The Left Provisonal Game (LPG) is defined on $\mathbb{U}\times\mathbb{U}$ as follows. (1) The positions are ordered pairs of games $[G,H]\in\mathbb{U}\times\mathbb{U}$; (2) The Left options of $[G,H]$ are of the form: (a) $[G^{L},H]\in\text{Proviso}(\mathbb{U})$; (b) $[G,H^{R}]\in\text{Proviso}(\mathbb{U})$. (3) The Right options are games of the form $[G^{R},H]$ or $[G,H^{L}]$; (4) A player who cannot move loses.
Definition 3.10. Let $\mathbb{A}$ be a totally ordered group and let $\Omega_{0}=\{\langle\emptyset^{\ell}\!\mid\!\emptyset^{r}\rangle\mid\ell,r\in% \mathbb{A}\}$. For $n>0$, the set $\Omega_{n}$ is the set of all games with finite sets of options in $\Omega_{n-1}$, including games which are left- and/or right-atomic, and the set of games of rank $n$ is $\Omega_{n}\setminus\Omega_{n-1}$. Let $\Omega=\cup_{n\geq 0}\Omega_{n}$. Then $(\Omega,\mathbb{A})$ is a free space of games.
Definition 3.18. A universe $\mathbb{U}$ of combinatorial games is an Absolute Universe if it is both parental and dense.
Definition 3.14. A universe of games, $\mathbb{U}\subseteq\Omega$, is a subspace of a given combinatorial game space $\Omega=((\Omega,\mathbb{A}),\mathbb{S},\nu_{L},\nu_{R},+)$, with: (1) $\boldsymbol{a}=\langle\emptyset^{a}\mid\emptyset^{a}\rangle\in\mathbb{U}$ for all $a\in\mathbb{A}$; (2) options closure: if $A\in\mathbb{U}$ and $B$ is an option of $A$ then $B\in\mathbb{U}$; (3) disjunctive sum closure: if $A,B\in\mathbb{U}$ then $A+B\in\mathbb{U}$; (4) conjugate closure: if $A\in\mathbb{U}$ then $\overset{\leftrightarrow}{A}\in\mathbb{U}$;
Definition 2.8. The Lie algebroid of a groupoid $G$ is the vector bundle $A_{G}:=\ker Ts|_{G_{0}}\subset TG_{1}|_{G_{0}}$ over $G_{0}$ with anchor map $\rho:A_{G}\to TG_{0}$ the restriction of $Tt|_{G_{0}}:TG_{1}|_{G_{0}}\to TG_{0}$ to the subbundle $A_{G}$.
Definition 2.2. A wide subgroupoid of a Lie groupoid $G$ is a map of Lie groupoids $i:U\to G$ so that $i$ is an open embedding on objects and morphisms (hence we can regard $U\subset G$) and the bibundle $\langle i\rangle:U\rightsquigarrow G$ is (weakly) invertible.
Definition 4.1. Consider the tangent groupoid $\pi:TG\to G$ of a Lie groupoid $G$. The category $\mathbb{X}(G)$ of multiplicative vector fields is defined as follows. The objects are functors $X:G\to TG$ such that $\pi_{G}\circ X=\mathrm{id}_{G}$. A morphism in $\mathbb{X}(G)$ from a multiplicative vector field $X$ to a multiplicative vector fields $Y$ is a natural transformation $\beta:X\Rightarrow Y$ such that $\pi\star\epsilon=1_{id_{G}}$.
Definition 2.13. (see [5, Definition 15]) A crossed module of Lie algebras consists of a Lie algebra homomorphism $\mu:\mathfrak{m}\to\mathfrak{n}$ together with an action of $\mathfrak{n}$ on $\mathfrak{m}$ by derivations, that is a Lie algebra homomorphism $\nu:\mathfrak{n}\to\mathsf{Der}(\mathfrak{m})$ from $\mathfrak{n}$ to the Lie algebra $\mathsf{Der}(\mathfrak{m})$ of derivations of $\mathfrak{m}$ so that for all $m,m^{\prime}\in\mathfrak{m}$, $n\in\mathfrak{n}$ (i) $\mu(\nu(n)m)=[n,\mu(m)]$ and (ii) $\nu(\mu(m))m^{\prime}=[m,m^{\prime}]$.
Definition 2.1. A (left-principal) bibundle from $H$ to $G$, denoted $P:H\rightsquigarrow G$, is a smooth manifold $P$ with left and right anchor maps $a_{P}^{L}$ and $a_{P}^{R}$, $\xy(-19,8)*+{G_{1}}="1";(-19,-10)*+{G_{0}}="2";(19,8)*+{H_{1}}="3";(19,-10)*+{% H_{0}}="4";(0,5)*+{P}="5";{\ar@{->}(-20,6);(-20,-7)};{\ar@{->}(-18,6);(-18,-7)% };{\ar@{->}(20,6);(20,-7)};{\ar@{->}(18,6);(18,-7)};{\ar@{->}_{a^{L}_{P}}"5";"% 2"};{\ar@{->}^{a^{R}_{P}}"5";"4"};\endxy$ along with a left action of $G$ and right action of $H$ $G_{1}\times_{s,G_{0},a_{P}^{L}}P\to P\quad(g,p)\mapsto g\cdot p,\quad\quad P% \times_{a_{P}^{R},H_{0},t}H_{1}\to P\quad(p,h)\mapsto p\cdot h,$ that commute with each other and satisfy associative and unital conditions. Finally, we require that the map $P\times_{a_{P}^{R},H_{0},t}H_{1}\to P\times_{a_{P}^{L},G_{0},a_{P}^{L}}P\quad% \quad(p,h)\mapsto(p,p\cdot h)$ is a diffeomorphism, i.e., the $H$ action is principal.
Definition 3.3. The objects of the category of vector fields $\mathbb{X}({\mathcal{X}})$ on a stack ${\mathcal{X}}$ are pairs $(X,\alpha_{X})$ where $X:{\mathcal{X}}\to T{\mathcal{X}}$ is a 1-morphism of stacks and $\alpha_{X}:\pi_{\mathcal{X}}\circ X\Rightarrow\mathrm{id}_{\mathcal{X}}$ is a 2-morphism. A morphism from $(X,\alpha_{X})$ to $(Y,\alpha_{Y})$ in $\mathbb{X}({\mathcal{X}})$ is a 2-morphism $\beta:X\Rightarrow Y$ so that $\alpha_{Y}\circ(\pi_{\mathcal{X}}\star\beta)=\alpha_{X}.$
Definition 3.7. Let $G$ be a Lie groupoid and $\pi:TG\to G$ the corresponding tangent Lie groupoid. The category of generalized vector fields $\mathbb{X}_{\mathsf{Bibund}}(G)$ on $G$ is defined as follows. The objects of $\mathbb{X}_{\mathsf{Bibund}}(G)$ are pairs $(P:G\rightsquigarrow TG,\alpha_{P}:\langle\pi_{G}\rangle\circ P\to\langle{id_{% G}}\rangle)$ where $P$ is a bibundle and $\alpha_{P}$ is an isomorphism of bibundles. A morphism $\beta$ in $\mathbb{X}_{\mathsf{Bibund}}(G)$ from $(P,\alpha_{P})$ to $(Q,\alpha_{Q})$ is a map of bibundles $\beta:P\to Q$ so that $\alpha_{Q}=\alpha_{P}\circ({\langle\pi\rangle}\star\beta).$ Here as before $\star$ denotes whiskering in $\mathsf{Bibund}$ and $\circ$ is the vertical composition.
Definition 2.10. A stack $\mathcal{X}$ is geometric if there exists a manifold $U$ and a morphism of stacks $p:U\to\mathcal{X}$ such that for all manifolds $N$ and all maps $q:N\to\mathcal{X}$, the (weak) 2-pullback $\xy(-10,10)*+{U\times_{\mathcal{X}}N}="1";(10,10)*+{U}="2";(-10,-6)*+{N}="3";(% 10,-6)*+{\mathcal{X}}="4";{\ar@{->}"1";"2"};{\ar@{->}"1";"3"};{\ar@{->}^{p}"2"% ;"4"};{\ar@{->}_{q}"3";"4"};\endxy$ is a manifold and $U\times_{\mathcal{X}}N\to N$ is a surjective submersion. In this case, $U$ is called an atlas of $\mathcal{X}$. Let $\mathsf{GeomStack}$ denote the full sub 2-category of stacks whose objects are geometric stacks.
Definition 2.3. Let $C,D$ be double categories. Let $F,G:C\to D$ be double functors from $C$ to $D$. We will understand for a double natural transformation from $F$ to $G$ a natural transformation from $F$ to $G$ internal to 2-category Cat of categories, functors, and natural transformations. More precisely, a double natural transformation $\eta:F\to G$ from $F$ to $G$ consists of a pair of natural transformations $\eta_{0}:F_{0}\to G_{0}$ and $\eta_{1}:F_{1}\to G_{1}$. We call $\eta_{0}$ the object natural transformation of $\eta$ and $\eta_{1}$ the morphism natural transformation of $\eta$. We require $\eta_{0}$ and $\eta_{1}$ to satisfy the following conditions: 1. Source and target: Let $f$ be a horizontal morphism of $C$ with domain and codomain $a$ and $b$ respectively. In that case the following equations hold. $s\eta_{f}=\eta_{x}\ \mbox{and}\ t\eta_{f}=\eta_{y}$ 2. Horizontal identity: Let $x$ be an object in $C$. In that case the following equation holds. $\eta_{i_{x}}\mu^{F}=\mu^{G}i_{\eta_{x}}$ 3. Horizontal composition: Let $f,g$ be a composable pair of horizontal morphisms of $C$. In that case the following equation holds. $\eta_{g\ast f}\nu^{F}_{g\ast f}=\nu^{G}_{Gg\ast Gf}(\eta_{g}\ast\eta_{f})$
Definition 3.4. Let $C$ be a globularily generated double category. Let $\Phi$ be a 2-morphism in $C$. We call the minimal integer $n$ such that $\Phi$ is a morphism of $n$-th vertical category $V^{C}_{n}$ associated to $C$ the vertical length of $\Phi$.
Definition 2.1. We understand, for a double category, a category weakly internal to 2-category Cat of categories, functors, and natural transformations. More precisely, a double category $C$ consists of the following data: 1. Objects and morphisms: Categories $C_{0},C_{1}$. We call $C_{0}$ the category of objects of $C$ and $C_{1}$ the category of morphism of $C$. 2. Source and target: Functors $s,t:C_{1}\to C_{0}$. We call $s$ and $t$ the source and target functors of $C$ respectively. 3. Horizontal identity: Functor $i:C_{0}\to C_{1}$. We call $i$ the horizontal identity functor of $C$. 4. Horizontal composition: Bifunctor $\ast:C_{1}\times_{C_{0}}C_{1}\to C_{1}$, where fibration in $C_{1}\times_{C_{0}}C_{1}$ is taken with respect to pair $s,t$. We call $\ast$ the horizontal composition bifunctor of $C$. 5. Identity transformations: Natural isomorphisms $\lambda:\ast(is\times id_{C_{1}})\to id_{C_{1}}$ and $\rho:\ast(id_{C_{1}}\times it)\to id_{C_{1}}$. We call $\lambda$ and $\rho$ the left and right identity transformations of $C$ respectively. 6. Associator: Natural isomorphism $\xi:\ast(\ast\times id_{C_{1}})\to\ast(id_{C_{1}}\times\ast)$. We call $\xi$ the associator of $C$. We require left and right identity transformations and associator of $C$ to be related by McLane’s triangular and pentagonal axioms [6]. Moreover, we require that source and target of each component of left and right identity transformations and associator of $C$ be identity endomorphisms in $C_{0}$.
Definition 3.1. Let $C$ be a double category. We say that $C$ is a globularily generated double category if $C$ is generated by its collection of globular 2-morphisms.
Definition 2.2. Let $C,D$ be double categories. We understand for a double functor from $C$ to $D$, a functor from $C$ to $D$, internal to 2-category Cat of categories, functors, and natural transformations. More precisely, a double functor $F:C\to D$ from $C$ to $D$ consists of the following data: 1. Components: Functors $F_{0}:C_{0}\to D_{0}$ and $F_{1}:C_{1}\to D_{1}$. We call $F_{0}$ the object functor of $F$ and we call $F_{1}$ the morphism functor of $F$. 2. Unit transformation: Natural isomorphism $\mu^{F}:F_{1}i\to iF_{0}$. We call $\mu$ the unit transformation of $F$. 3. Composition: Natural isomorphism $\nu^{G}:\ast(F_{1}\times F_{1})\to F_{1}\ast$. We call $\nu$ the horizontal composition transformation of $F$ We require object and morphism functors of $F$ to intertwine source and target functors of $C$ and $D$. We require components of unit and horizontal composition transformations of $F$ to be globular isomorphisms. Finally, we require unit and horizontal composition transformations of $F$ to satisfy McLane’s coherence conditions for a monoidal functor [6].
Definition 5.2. Let $(p,S)$ be a non-crossing partial partition of $S$, the Kreweras complement $\operatorname{kr}(p)$ of $p$ is the biggest partial partition $(p^{\prime},S^{c})$ such that $(p,S)\vee(p^{\prime},S^{c})$ is non-crossing.
Definition 2.6 ([FP16]). Let $\mathbb{G}$ be a compact quantum group. Define $C(\mathbb{G}\wr_{*}\mathbb{G}_{aut}(A,\operatorname{tr}))$ to be the universal unital $C^{*}$-algebra generated by the coefficients of $a(x)\in B(\mathcal{H}\otimes\mathcal{H}_{x})\otimes\operatorname{Pol}(\mathbb{% G}\wr_{*}\mathbb{G}_{aut}(A,\operatorname{tr})),\ x\in\operatorname{Irr}(% \mathbb{G})$, satisfying the relations: • $a(x)$ is unitary for any $x\in\operatorname{Irr}(\mathbb{G})$, • For all $x,y,z\in\operatorname{Irr}(\mathbb{G})$ and all $S\in\operatorname{Mor}(x\otimes y,z)$ $(m\otimes S)\circ\Sigma_{23}\in\operatorname{Mor}(a(x)\otimes a(y),a(z)),$ where $\Sigma_{23}:\mathcal{H}\otimes\mathcal{H}_{x}\otimes\mathcal{H}\otimes\mathcal% {H}_{y}\to\mathcal{H}\otimes\mathcal{H}\otimes\mathcal{H}_{x}\otimes\mathcal{H% }_{y}$ is the tensor flip on the second and third leg. • $\eta\in\operatorname{Mor}(\mathbbm{1},a(\mathbbm{1}_{\mathbb{G}}))$. The compact quantum group $\mathbb{G}\wr_{*}\mathbb{G}_{aut}(A,\operatorname{tr})=(C(\mathbb{G}\wr_{*}% \mathbb{G}_{aut}(A,\operatorname{tr})),\Delta)$ with comultiplication as defined in [FP16, Proposition 2.7] is called the free wreath product of $\mathbb{G}$ and $\mathbb{G}_{aut}(A,\operatorname{tr})$.
Definition 3.1 ([J99]). A planar tangle $T$ of degree $k\geq 0$ consists of the following data. • A disk $D_{0}$ of $\mathbb{R}^{2}$, called the outer disk. • Some disjoint disks $D_{1},\dots,D_{n}$ in the interior of $D_{0}$ which are called the inner disks. • For each $0\leq i\leq n$, a finite subset $S_{i}\in\partial D_{i}$ of cardinality $2k_{i}$ (such that $k_{0}=k$) with a distinguished element $i_{*}\in S_{i}$. The elements of $S_{i}$ are called the boundary points of $D_{i}$ and numbered clockwise starting from $i_{*}$. $k_{i}$ is called the degree of the inner disk $D_{i}$. Whenever we draw pictures, we will distinguish $i_{*}$ by marking the boundary region of $D_{i}$ preceding $i_{*}$ by $*$. • A finite set of disjoint smooth curves $\{\gamma_{j}\}_{1\leq j\leq r}$ such that each $\mathring{\gamma}_{j}$ lies in the interior of $D_{0}\setminus\bigcup_{i\geq 1}D_{i}$ and such that $\bigcup_{1\leq j\leq r}\partial\gamma_{j}=\bigcup_{0\leq i\leq n}S_{i}$; it is also required that each curve meets a disk boundary orthogonally, and that its endpoints have opposite (resp. same) parity if they both belong to inner disks or both belong to the outer disk (resp. one belongs to an inner disk and the other one to the outer disk). • A region of $P$ is a connected component of $D_{0}\setminus(\bigcup_{i\geq 1}D_{i}\cup(\bigcup\gamma_{j}))$. Give a chessboard shading on the regions of $P$ in such a way that the interval components of type $(2i-1,2i)$ are boundaries of shaded regions. The skeleton of $T$, denoted by $\Gamma T$, is the set $(\bigcup\partial D_{i})\cup(\bigcup\gamma_{j})$.
Definition 6.3. Let $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{Q}$ be two planar algebras. The free product planar algebra $\mathcal{P}*\mathcal{Q}$ is the collection of vector subspaces $(\mathcal{P}*\mathcal{Q})_{k}$ of $(\mathcal{P}\otimes\mathcal{Q})_{k}$ spanned by the image of the maps $Z_{T}\otimes Z_{T^{\prime}}$ for all free pairs of planar tangles of degree $k$.
Definition 3.5 ([J01]). Let $\mathcal{P}=(\mathcal{P}_{n})_{n\in\mathbb{N}_{*}\cup\{+,-\}}$ be a planar algebra. A left module over $\mathcal{P}$ is a graded vector space $V=(V_{n})_{n\in\mathbb{N}_{*}\cup\{+,-\}}$ such that, given an annular $(m,n)$-tangle $T$ with input disk $D_{1}$ and other internal disks $D_{i},\ i=2,\dots,s$ of degree $k_{i}$, there is a linear map $Z_{T}:V_{m}\otimes(\otimes_{p=2}^{s}P_{k_{p}})\to V_{n}.$ We require the family $(Z_{T})_{T}$ to be compatible with both the composition of annular tangles and the composition with arbitrary tangles.
Definition 9.1. A subspace $(L_{n})_{n\geq 1}$ of $\mathcal{P}$ is called a Boolean decomposition of $\mathcal{P}$ if we have the direct sum decomposition $\mathcal{P}_{n}=\bigoplus_{I\in\mathcal{I}(n)}L(I)$ for all $n\geq 1$.
Definition 3.8. A special $(m,n)$-tangle is an annular $(m,n)$-tangle having exactly one non-distinguished disk of degree $(m+n)$. We ask for the first $2n$ boundary points of this disk to be connected by strings to the boundary points of the outer disk in such a way that marked boundary points are connected. The other $2m$ boundary points are required to be connected to the input disk with the marked boundary point of the input disk being connected to the last boundary point of the non-distinguished disk.
Definition 2.5 ([Bi04]). Let $\mathbb{G}$ be a compact matrix quantum group with fundamental representation $v=(v_{kl})_{1\leq k,l\leq m}$ and let $\mathbb{F}$ be a quantum subgroup of $S_{n}^{+}$ with fundamental representation $u=(u_{ij})_{1\leq i,j\leq n}$. Define the unital $C^{*}$-algebra $C(\mathbb{G}\wr_{*}\mathbb{F})$ as the quotient of $C(\mathbb{G})^{*n}*C(\mathbb{F})$ by the relations that make the $i$-th copy of $C(\mathbb{G})$ inside the free product commute with the $i$-th row of $u$. Set $w=(v_{kl}^{i}u_{ij})_{(i,k)(j,l)}$ where $v^{i}_{kl}$ denotes the image of $v_{kl}$ inside the $i$-th copy of $C(\mathbb{G})$. The compact matrix quantum group $\mathbb{G}\wr_{*}\mathbb{F}=(C(\mathbb{G}\wr_{*}\mathbb{F}),w)$ is called the free wreath product of $\mathbb{G}$ and $\mathbb{F}$.
Definition 3.3 ([J99]). A subfactor planar algebra $\mathcal{P}$ is a $C^{*}$-planar algebra such that • $\mathcal{P}$ is spherical, • $\dim\mathcal{P}_{+}=\dim\mathcal{P}_{-}=1,$ • For every $n$, the linear map $\operatorname{Tr}_{n}$ induced by the $n$-th trace tangles satisfies $\operatorname{Tr}(x^{*}x)>0$ for all $0\neq x\in\mathcal{P}_{n}$.
Definition 5.8. Let $\pi\in NC(2k)$. The nested Kreweras complement of $\pi$, denoted by $\operatorname{kr}^{\prime}(\pi)$, is the partition of $2k$ such that $\tilde{f}(\operatorname{kr}^{\prime}(\pi))=\operatorname{kr}(\tilde{\pi},S)$.
Definition 9.2. The $n$-th Boolean orthogonal subspace of $\mathcal{P}$, denoted by $\mathcal{B}_{\mathcal{P}}(n)$, is the orthogonal complement of $\bigcup\limits_{\begin{subarray}{c}k,m\geq 1\\ k+m=n\end{subarray}}U_{k,m}(\mathcal{P}_{k}\otimes\mathcal{P}_{m})$ in $\mathcal{P}_{n}$.
Definition 5.1. Let $k\geq 1$. A partial partition of $\llbracket 1,k\rrbracket$ is a pair $(p,S)$ consisting of a subset $S$ of $\llbracket 1,k\rrbracket$ and a a partition $p$ of order $|S|$.
Definition 7.5. Let $\alpha$ (respectively $\beta$) be an action of the compact quantum group $\mathbb{F}$ (resp. $\mathbb{G}$) on the finite-dimensional $C^{*}$-algebra $A\ (B)$. Assume that both $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are faithful, centrally ergodic and preserve the Markov trace on $A$, respectively $B$. The action $\beta\wr_{*}\alpha:A\otimes B\to A\otimes B\otimes C(\mathbb{H})$ corresponding to $\mathcal{P}(\alpha)*\mathcal{P}(\beta)\ \subset\ \mathcal{P}^{\Gamma(A\otimes B)}$ is called the free wreath action of $\beta$ and $\alpha$ and the compact matrix quantum group $(\mathbb{H},u_{\beta\wr_{*}\alpha}$ is called the free wreath product of $(\mathbb{G},u_{\beta})$ and $(\mathbb{F},u_{\alpha})$.
Definition 3.4 ([J01]). Let $m,n\in\mathbb{N}_{*}\cup\{+,-\}$. An annular tangle is a planar tangle together with a fixed choice of an inner disk which will henceforth be called the input disk. An annular $(m,n)$-tangle is an annular tangle whose outer disk has $2n$ boundary points and whose input disk has $2m$ boundary points.
Definition 6.1. Let $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{Q}$ be two planar algebras. The tensor product planar algebra $\mathcal{P}\otimes\mathcal{Q}$ is the collection of vector spaces $(\mathcal{P}\otimes\mathcal{Q})_{i}=\mathcal{P}_{i}\otimes\mathcal{Q}_{i}$, with the action of any planar tangle being given by the tensor product of the action on each component. More precisely, for a planar tangle $T$, $Z_{T}(\bigotimes_{D_{i}}(x_{i}\otimes y_{i}))=Z_{T}(\bigotimes_{D_{i}}x_{i})% \otimes Z_{T}(\bigotimes_{D_{i}}y_{i}),$ where $x_{i}\in\mathcal{P}_{k_{i}}$ and $y_{i}\in\mathcal{Q}_{k_{i}}$.
Definition 3.2 ([J99]). A planar algebra $\mathcal{P}$ is a collection of finite-dimensional vector spaces $(\mathcal{P}_{n})_{n\in\mathbb{N}^{*}\cup\{-,+\}}$ such that each planar tangle $T$ of degree $k$ with $n$ inner disks $D_{1},\dots,D_{n}$ of respective degree $k_{1},\dots,k_{n}$ yields a linear map $Z_{T}:\bigotimes_{1\leq i\leq n}\mathcal{P}_{k_{i}}\longrightarrow\mathcal{P}_% {k}.$ We require the composition of such maps to be compatible with the composition of planar tangles. More precisely, if $T^{\prime}$ is another tangle of degree $k_{i_{0}}$ for some $1\leq i_{0}\leq n$, then $Z_{T}\circ(\bigotimes_{i\not=i_{0}}\text{Id}_{\mathcal{P}_{k_{i}}}\otimes Z_{T% ^{\prime}})=Z_{T\circ_{D_{i_{0}}}T^{\prime}}.$ If every $\mathcal{P}_{n}$ possesses a conjugate linear involution which commutes with the involution of planar tangles, $\mathcal{P}$ is called a planar $*$-algebra. If $\mathcal{P}_{n}$ is a $C^{*}$-algebra under this involution it is called a $\mathbb{C}^{*}$-planar algebra.
Definition 6.7. A free pair $(T,T^{\prime})$ of planar tangles is called reduced if $T=T_{\pi}$ and $T^{\prime}=T_{kr^{\prime}(\pi)}$ for some non-crossing partition $\pi$ such that $\pi\geq\pi_{0}$.
Definition 3.6 ([J01]). Let $\mathcal{P}=(\mathcal{P}_{n})_{n\in\mathbb{N}_{*}\cup\{+,-\}}$ be a $C^{*}$-planar algebra. A $\mathcal{P}$-module $V=(V_{k})_{n\in\mathbb{N}_{*}\cup\{+,-\}}$ will be called a Hilbert $\mathcal{P}$-module if each $V_{n}$ is a finite-dimensional Hilbert space with inner product $\langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle_{n}$ such that $\langle Z_{T}(v,x_{2},\dots,x_{s}),w\rangle_{n}=\langle v,Z_{T^{*}}(w,x_{2}^{*% },\dots,x_{s}^{*})\rangle_{m}$ whenever $T$ is an annular $(m,n)$-tangle with non-distinguished internal disks $D_{i},i=2,\dots,s$ of respective degree $k_{i}$, $\ x_{i}\in\mathcal{P}_{k_{i}}$ and $v\in V_{m},\ w\in V_{n}$.
Definition 8.1 ([dCFY14], [PV15]). The discrete dual of $\mathbb{G}$ satisfies • the central Haagerup property if there exists a net of positive functions $\varphi_{i}:\operatorname{Irr}(\mathbb{G})\to\mathbb{C}$ in $c_{0}(\operatorname{Irr}(\mathbb{G}))$ such that $\varphi_{i}\to 1$ pointwise as $i\to\infty$; • the central almost completely positive approximation property (ACPAP) if there exists a net of positive functions $\varphi_{i}:\operatorname{Irr}(\mathbb{G})\to\mathbb{C}$ that converges to $1$ pointwise and such that for every fixed $i$, there exists a net of finitely supported completely bounded functions $\psi_{i}^{k}:\operatorname{Irr}(\mathbb{G})\to\mathbb{C}$ such that $\lim_{k}\|\psi_{i}^{k}-\varphi_{i}\|_{cb}=0$.
Definition 5.4. Let $T$ be a planar tangle of degree $k$. The partition of $T$, denoted by $\pi_{T}$, is the set partition of $\llbracket 1,2k\rrbracket$ such that $i\sim_{\pi_{T}}j$ if and only if the distinguished points $i$ and $j$ of the outer disk $D_{0}$ belong to the closure of the same connected component of $\Gamma T\setminus\partial D_{0}$.
Definition 9. Let $(\Omega,\mathcal{F},P)$ be a probability space ($\Omega=$ outcomes, $\mathcal{F}=$ events is a $\sigma$-algebra over $\Omega$, and $P:\mathcal{F}\rightarrow[0,1]$ is a probability measure), and $(S,\Sigma)$ be a measurable space ($S$ is a set and $\Sigma$ is a $\sigma$-algebra over $S$). Then a random variable, $X:\Omega\rightarrow S$, is an $(\mathcal{F},\Sigma)$-measurable function. An $S$-valued stochastic process is a collection of $S$-valued random variables on $\Omega$, indexed by a totally ordered set, $T$ (think “time”). I.e., a stochastic process is a collection $\{X_{t}:t\in T\}$ where each $X_{t}$ is an $S$-valued random variable on $\Omega$.
Definition 4. A (covariant) functor, $F:C\rightarrow D$, from category $C$ to category $D$ is a mapping that satisfies the following properties • For each $X\in Ob(C)$ we have $F(X)\in Ob(D)$ • For each morphism $f:X\rightarrow Y$ in $Hom_{C}(X,Y)$ we map to morphism $F(f):F(X)\rightarrow F(Y)$ in $Hom_{D}(F(X),F(Y))$ such that: – $F(id_{X})=id_{F(X)}$ for every $X\in C$, and – $F(g\circ f)=F(g)\circ F(f)$ for all morphisms $f:X\rightarrow Y$ and $g:Y\rightarrow Z$.
Definition 6. A semiring is a set $S$ with two binary relations, $+$ and $\cdot$, which are called addition and multiplication respectively such that: • $(R,+)$ is a commutative monoid (operation is associative and commutative but does not necessarily have inverses) with identity 0. • $(R,\cdot)$ monoid (operation is associative and does not necessarily have inverses) with identity 1. • Multiplication (left and right) distributes over addition. • Multiplication by 0 annihilates $R$. A partially ordered semiring is a semiring, $R$, with a partial order relation $\leq$ on $R$ satisfying: (a) if $a\leq b$ then $a+c\leq b+c$, and (b) if $a\leq b$ and $0\leq c$ then $ac\leq bc$ and $ca\leq cb$.
