Definition 4.5. For $n\geq 0$ the standard ppset $[[n]]$ is the degree $1$ ppset defined as follows: As a partially ordered set it is ${\mathbb{Z}}$ and the generator $T_{1}$ is translation by $n+1$.
Definition 6.5. The geometric realization of a compact $P\in{\mathcal{PP}}$ is the topological space $||P||$ defined as followed: As a set $||P||$ is the subset of ${\operatorname{Hom}}_{\mathcal{PP}}(S^{1},P)$ of morphisms where the underlying map of sets is upper semicontinuous when $P$ is taken to have the discrete topology. restriction of maps to $I\subset{\mathbb{R}}$ and projection on ${\mathbb{Z}}^{k}\backslash P$ gives an embedding of $||P||$ into a space of maps from $I$ to ${\mathbb{Z}}^{k}\backslash P$ and the metric on $||P||$ is then defined similarly to the one in definition 3.3.
Definition 6.8. The standard cyclic $n$ simplex is ${\tilde{\Delta}}_{n}:=\mathcal{C}([[n]])$.
Definition 4.7. Suppose $C$ is a category and $M$ is a $C$-module. (1) When $Q\in M$, the functor $C\rightarrow{\operatorname{\tt Set}}$ given on objects by $P\rightarrow{\operatorname{Hom}}(P,Q)$ (visibly seen to be a functor), is called the functor represented by $Q$. (2) An object $Q_{3}\in M$ is a product of objects $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$ in $M$ if $Q_{3}$ represents the product of the functors represented by $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$ (note that, unlike the case of categories, the product need not be unique).
Definition 4.2. The category ${\mathcal{PP}_{1}}$ is the category whose objects are degree $1$ ppsets and whose morphisms are morphisms of ppsets.
Definition 6.2. A ppset $P$ is called archimedean if it is of degree $1$, totally ordered and for any $x$ and $y$ in $P$ there is some $n\in{\mathbb{Z}}$ such that $T_{1}^{n}x>y$.
Definition 3.1. The simplicial realization of a partially ordered set $P$ is the simplicial set ${\mathcal{S}}(P)$ defined by ${\mathcal{S}}(P)([n])={\operatorname{Hom}}_{\mathcal{P}}([n],P).$
Definition 5.1. The category ${\tilde{\Delta}}$ has the same objects as $\Delta$. The sets of morphisms are given by ${\operatorname{Hom}}_{{\tilde{\Delta}}}([n],[m])={\operatorname{Hom}}_{\Delta}% ([n],[m])\times K([n]),$ and the composition of $(\phi,u)\in{\operatorname{Hom}}_{\Delta}([m],[k])\times K([m])$ and $(\chi,v)\in{\operatorname{Hom}}_{\Delta}([n],[m])\times K([n])$ is defined by $(\phi,u)\circ(\chi,v)=(\phi\circ u_{\ast}\chi,\chi^{\ast}u\circ v).$ Here, the order preserving map $u_{\ast}\chi$ and the cyclic permutation $\chi^{\ast}u$ are defined as follows: For $i\in[m]$ let $A_{i}=\chi^{-1}(i)$ and let $B_{u(i)}=A_{i}$. Then $[n]$ can be given a new ordering as the ordered union of the posets $B_{i}$. The cyclic permutation $\chi^{\ast}u$ is the unique automorphism of $[n]$ which is order preserving from $[n]$ with the new ordering to $[n]$ with the standard one. Finally $\chi^{\ast}u:=u\chi(\chi^{\ast}u)^{-1}$.
Definition 6.4. We will say that an archimedean ppset $P$ is positive (resp. negative) if for one (hence any) $x\in P$, $T_{1}(x)>x$ (resp. $T_{1}(x)<x$).
Definition 4.3. Let $C$ be a category. A module $M$ over $C$ is made up of the following data: (1) A class of objects ${\operatorname{Obj}}(M)$. (2) For any $P\in C$ and $Q\in M$, a set ${\operatorname{Hom}}(P,Q)$. (3) For any $P,R\in C$ and $Q\in M$ a composition map ${\operatorname{Hom}}(R,P)\times{\operatorname{Hom}}(P,Q)\rightarrow{% \operatorname{Hom}}(R,Q)$. The composition of morphisms should satisfy all the axioms of category theory when applicable. If $M^{\prime}$ is a $C^{\prime}$ module then a functor $F$ from $M$ to $M^{\prime}$ consists of (1) A functor $F:C\rightarrow C^{\prime}$. (2) a map $F:{\operatorname{Obj}}(M)\rightarrow{\operatorname{Obj}}(M^{\prime})$. (3) For any $P\in C$, $Q\in M$, a map $F:{\operatorname{Hom}}(P,Q)\rightarrow{\operatorname{Hom}}(F(P),F(Q))$ satisfying the obvious compatibilities.
Definition 6.9. The geometric realization of a cyclic set $C$ is given by: $||C||=\mathchoice{\underset{{\tilde{\Delta}}_{n}\rightarrow C}{\varinjlim}}{% \varinjlim_{{\tilde{\Delta}}_{n}\rightarrow C}}{}{}||[[n]]||.$ The limit is taken in the category of topological spaces with circle action.
Definition 4.6. The category ${\tilde{\nabla}}$ is the subcategory of ${\mathcal{PP}_{1}}$ whose objects are $[[n]]$ for $n=0,1,\ldots$.
Definition 6.7. The cyclic realization $\mathcal{C}(P)$ of a ppset $P$ is the restriction to ${\tilde{\nabla}}$ of the functor on ${\mathcal{PP}_{1}}$ represented by $P$.
Definition 4.1. A periodic partially ordered set (ppset for short), of degree $k>0$, is a partially ordered set $P$ together with an action of ${\mathbb{Z}}^{k}$ by order preserving transformations. In other words, to give a ppset of degree $k$ is to give the poset $P$ together with a collection of commuting order preserving automorphisms $T_{1},\ldots,T_{k}$ (We will call the automorphisms obtained by the action of ${\mathbb{Z}}^{k}$ the shifts of $P$). A map $f:P\rightarrow Q$ between two ppsets is a function $f$ which is order preserving and satisfies the relation $f\circ(1,1,\ldots,1)=(1,1,\ldots,1)\circ f$ where the symbol $(1,1,\ldots,1)$ represents the action of the appropriate group element (which could of course be different in $P$ and $Q$). We write ${\operatorname{Map}}(P,Q)$ for the set of maps between ppsets $P$ and $Q$. A morphism between two ppsets $P$ and $Q$ is an equivalence class of maps. The equivalence is given by precomposition with the shifts of $P$ and postcomposition with the shifts of $Q$. The set of morphisms between $P$ and $Q$ is denoted ${\operatorname{Hom}}(P,Q)$.
Definition 6.1. a ppset $P$ of degree $k$ is compact if ${\mathbb{Z}}^{k}\backslash P$ is finite.
Definition 1.1 A double $P$-module consists of three morphisms of categories all over the identity on objects: $\xymatrix{M\ar[dr]^{\mu}&H\ar[d]^{\phi}\\ V\ar[r]_{\psi}&P}$ such that $M$ is totally intransitive, i.e. is a union of monoids, so that $\mathsf{s}=\mathsf{t}$ on $M$. We write $M(x)$ for $M(x,x)$. Further, there are given right actions of both $H$ and $V$ on $M$. This means that if $m\in M(x)$ and $d\in H(x,y)$ then there is defined $m^{d}\in M(y)$ and the usual axioms for an action are satisfied, namely $(mm_{1})^{h}=m^{h}m_{1}^{h}$, $m^{hk}=(m^{h})^{k}$, whenever these make sense, and $1^{h}=1,m^{1}=m$, and similarly for the action of $V$ on $M$. We do not suppose these actions commute, but nonetheless we agree to write $m^{dz}$ when $\mathsf{t}m=\mathsf{s}d$ and $\mathsf{t}d=\mathsf{s}z$. However $dz$ is here interpreted formally, or, if you like, as an arrow of the free product category $H*V$ over the same set of objects as $H,V,M$. Thus $\mathsf{t}m^{dz}=\mathsf{t}z$. In order to write our axioms in a way which agrees with the above calculations, we agree ‘evaluate in $P$’ means apply the morphisms $\mu,\phi,\psi$ to the given equation to give an equation in $P$. Thus the equation ‘$ucm=av$ evaluated in $P$’ means not only that $(\psi u)(\phi c)(\mu m)=(\psi a)(\phi v)$ but also that the equation makes sense in that $\mathsf{s}a=\mathsf{s}u,\mathsf{t}a=\mathsf{s}v,\mathsf{t}u=\mathsf{s}c,% \mathsf{t}c=\mathsf{t}v\mathsf{t}m.$ Similarly, $md=dm^{d}\mbox{ evaluated in $P$ }$ means that $\mathsf{t}m=\mathsf{s}d$ and $(\mu m)(\phi d)=(\phi d)(\mu m^{d}).$ With this agreed, the axioms are: if $m,q\in M,d,f\in H,y,z\in V$ (i) then $md=dm^{d},my=ym^{y},\mbox{ evaluated in $P$ };$ (ii) if also $yfq=dz$ in $P$, then in $M$, $m^{yf}q=qm^{dz}.$
Definition 2.1. Let $\mathcal{T}$ be a triangulated category and $\Sigma$ the suspension functor of $\mathcal{T}$. We define a $\mathbb{Z}$-graded abelian group $Z^{*}(\mathcal{T})=Z^{*}(\mathcal{T},\Sigma)$ as follows. For any $n\in\mathbb{Z}$, let $Z^{n}(\mathcal{T})$ denote the collection of all natural transformations $\eta\colon\operatorname{Id}\nolimits\to\Sigma^{n}$ which satisfy $\eta\Sigma=(-1)^{n}\Sigma\eta$. The composition of natural transformations gives $Z^{*}(\mathcal{T})$ the structure of a graded commutative ring, and we call it the graded center of $\mathcal{T}$. Graded commutative here means that $\eta\zeta=(-1)^{mn}\zeta\eta$ for all $\eta\in Z^{n}(\mathcal{T})$ and $\zeta\in Z^{m}(\mathcal{T})$.
Definition 2. A $\mathbb{V}$-category $\mathbb{C}$ is regular if it is finitely complete, coequalizers of kernel pairs exist and the regular epis are stable under pullbacks and cotensors with the finite objects. A functor is regular if it preserves finite limits and regular epis.
Definition 2.10 Let ${\bf HLC}$ be the category of all locally compact Hausdorff spaces and all continuous maps between them. Let ${\bf DLC}$ be the category whose objects are all complete LCAs and whose morphisms are all functions $\varphi:(A,\rho,{\rm I}\!{\rm B})\longrightarrow(B,\eta,{\rm I}\!{\rm B}^{% \prime})$ between the objects of ${\bf DLC}$ satisfying conditions (PAL1)-(PAL4) (which will be denoted also by (DLCi) for $i=1\div 4$) and the following constrain: (DLC5) $\varphi(a)=\bigvee\{\varphi(b)\ |\ b\in{\rm I}\!{\rm B},b\ll_{\rho}a\}$, for every $a\in A$; let the composition $``\diamond$” of two morphisms $\varphi_{1}:(A_{1},\rho_{1},{\rm I}\!{\rm B}_{1})\longrightarrow(A_{2},\rho_{2% },{\rm I}\!{\rm B}_{2})$ and $\varphi_{2}:(A_{2},\rho_{2},{\rm I}\!{\rm B}_{2})\longrightarrow(A_{3},\rho_{3% },{\rm I}\!{\rm B}_{3})$ of ${\bf DLC}$ be defined by the formula $\varphi_{2}\diamond\varphi_{1}=(\varphi_{2}\circ\varphi_{1})\,\check{}\,,$ where, for every function $\psi:(A,\rho,{\rm I}\!{\rm B})\longrightarrow(B,\eta,{\rm I}\!{\rm B}^{\prime})$ between two objects of ${\bf DLC}$, $\psi\,\check{}\,:(A,\rho,{\rm I}\!{\rm B})\longrightarrow(B,\eta,{\rm I}\!{\rm B% }^{\prime})$ is defined as follows: $\psi\,\check{}\,(a)=\bigvee\{\psi(b)\ |\ b\in{\rm I}\!{\rm B},b\ll_{\rho}a\},$ for every $a\in A$. By ${\bf DHC}$ we denote the full subcategory of ${\bf DLC}$ having as objects all CNCAs (i.e., those CLCAs $(A,\rho,{\rm I}\!{\rm B})$ for which ${\rm I}\!{\rm B}=A$). (We used here the same notations as in Definition 2.6 for the composition between the morphisms of the category ${\bf DLC}$ and for the functions of the type $\psi\,\check{}\,$ because the NCAs can be regarded as those LCAs $(A,\rho,{\rm I}\!{\rm B})$ for which $A={\rm I}\!{\rm B}$, and hence the right sides of the formulas (35) and (31) coincide in the case of NCAs.)
Definition 1.15 Let $(B,\rho,{\rm I}\!{\rm B})$ be a local contact algebra. We will say that $\sigma$ is a cluster in $(B,\rho,{\rm I}\!{\rm B})$ if $\sigma$ is a cluster in the NCA $(B,C_{\rho})$ (see 1.13 and 1.14). A cluster $\sigma$ in $(B,\rho,{\rm I}\!{\rm B})$ (resp., an ultrafilter in $B$) is called bounded if $\sigma\cap{\rm I}\!{\rm B}\neq\emptyset$ (resp., $u\cap{\rm I}\!{\rm B}\neq\emptyset$). The set of all bounded clusters in $(B,\rho,{\rm I}\!{\rm B})$ will be denoted by $\mbox{{\rm BClust}}(B,\rho,{\rm I}\!{\rm B})$.
Definition 1.11 ([24]) An algebraic system $\underline{B}_{\,l}=(B,0,1,\vee,\wedge,{}^{*},\rho,{\rm I}\!{\rm B})$ is called a local contact Boolean algebra or, briefly, local contact algebra (abbreviated as LCA) if $(B,0,1,\vee,\wedge,{}^{*})$ is a Boolean algebra, $\rho$ is a binary relation on $B$ such that $(B,\rho)$ is a CA, and ${\rm I}\!{\rm B}$ is an ideal (possibly non proper) of $B$, satisfying the following axioms: (BC1) If $a\in{\rm I}\!{\rm B}$, $c\in B$ and $a\ll_{\rho}c$ then $a\ll_{\rho}b\ll_{\rho}c$ for some $b\in{\rm I}\!{\rm B}$ (see 1.1 for $``\ll_{\rho}$”); (BC2) If $a\rho b$ then there exists an element $c$ of ${\rm I}\!{\rm B}$ such that $a\rho(c\wedge b)$; (BC3) If $a\neq 0$ then there exists $b\in{\rm I}\!{\rm B}\setminus\{0\}$ such that $b\ll_{\rho}a$. We shall simply write $(B,\rho,{\rm I}\!{\rm B})$ for a local contact algebra. We will say that the elements of ${\rm I}\!{\rm B}$ are bounded and the elements of $B\setminus{\rm I}\!{\rm B}$ are unbounded. When $B$ is a complete Boolean algebra, the LCA $(B,\rho,{\rm I}\!{\rm B})$ is called a complete local contact Boolean algebra or, briefly, complete local contact algebra (abbreviated as CLCA). We will say that two local contact algebras $(B,\rho,{\rm I}\!{\rm B})$ and $(B_{1},\rho_{1},{\rm I}\!{\rm B}_{1})$ are LCA-isomorphic if there exists a Boolean isomorphism $\varphi:B\longrightarrow B_{1}$ such that, for $a,b\in B$, $a\rho b$ iff $\varphi(a)\rho_{1}\varphi(b)$, and $\varphi(a)\in{\rm I}\!{\rm B}_{1}$ iff $a\in{\rm I}\!{\rm B}$. A map $\varphi:(B,\rho,{\rm I}\!{\rm B})\longrightarrow(B_{1},\rho_{1},{\rm I}\!{\rm B% }_{1})$ is called an LCA-embedding if $\varphi:B\longrightarrow B_{1}$ is an injective Boolean homomorphism (i.e., Boolean monomorphism) and, moreover, for any $a,b\in B$, $a\rho b$ iff $\varphi(a)\rho_{1}\varphi(b)$, and $\varphi(a)\in{\rm I}\!{\rm B}_{1}$ iff $a\in{\rm I}\!{\rm B}$. An LCA $(B,\rho,{\rm I}\!{\rm B})$ is called connected if the CA $(B,\rho)$ is connected.
Definition 2.6 (De Vries [11]) Let ${\bf HC}$ be the category of all compact Hausdorff spaces and all continuous maps between them. Let ${\bf DVAL}$ be the category whose objects are all complete NCAs and whose morphisms are all functions $\varphi:(A,C)\longrightarrow(B,C^{\prime})$ between the objects of ${\bf DVAL}$ satisfying the conditions: (DVAL1) $\varphi(0)=0$; (DVAL2) $\varphi(a\wedge b)=\varphi(a)\wedge\varphi(b)$, for all $a,b\in A$; (DVAL3) If $a,b\in A$ and $a\ll_{C}b$, then $(\varphi(a^{*}))^{*}\ll_{C^{\prime}}\varphi(b)$; (DVAL4) $\varphi(a)=\bigvee\{\varphi(b)\ |\ b\ll_{C}a\}$, for every $a\in A$, and let the composition $``\diamond$” of two morphisms $\varphi_{1}:(A_{1},C_{1})\longrightarrow(A_{2},C_{2})$ and $\varphi_{2}:(A_{2},C_{2})\longrightarrow(A_{3},C_{3})$ of ${\bf DVAL}$ be defined by the formula $\varphi_{2}\diamond\varphi_{1}=(\varphi_{2}\circ\varphi_{1})\,\check{}\,,$ where, for every function $\psi:(A,C)\longrightarrow(B,C^{\prime})$ between two objects of ${\bf DVAL}$, $\psi\,\check{}\,:(A,C)\longrightarrow(B,C^{\prime})$ is defined as follows: $\psi\,\check{}\,(a)=\bigvee\{\psi(b)\ |\ b\ll_{C}a\},$ for every $a\in A$.
Definition 1.1 An algebraic system $\underline{B}=(B,0,1,\vee,\wedge,{}^{*},C)$ is called a contact Boolean algebra or, briefly, contact algebra (abbreviated as CA) ([11]) if $(B,0,1,\vee,\wedge,{}^{*})$ is a Boolean algebra (where the operation $``$complement” is denoted by $``\ {}^{*}\ $”) and $C$ is a binary relation on $B$, satisfying the following axioms: (C1) If $a\not=0$ then $aCa$; (C2) If $aCb$ then $a\not=0$ and $b\not=0$; (C3) $aCb$ implies $bCa$; (C4) $aC(b\vee c)$ iff $aCb$ or $aCc$. We shall simply write $(B,C)$ for a contact algebra. The relation $C$ is called a contact relation. When $B$ is a complete Boolean algebra, we will say that $(B,C)$ is a complete contact Boolean algebra or, briefly, complete contact algebra (abbreviated as CCA). If $a\in B$ and $D\subseteq B$, we will write $``aCD$” for $``(\forall d\in D)(aCd)$”. We will say that two CA’s $(B_{1},C_{1})$ and $(B_{2},C_{2})$ are CA-isomorphic iff there exists a Boolean isomorphism $\varphi:B_{1}\longrightarrow B_{2}$ such that, for each $a,b\in B_{1}$, $aC_{1}b$ iff $\varphi(a)C_{2}\varphi(b)$. Note that in this paper, by a $``$Boolean isomorphism” we understand an isomorphism in the category ${\bf Bool}$. A CA $(B,C)$ is called connected if it satisfies the following axiom: (CON) If $a\neq 0,1$ then $aCa^{*}$. A contact algebra $(B,C)$ is called a normal contact Boolean algebra or, briefly, normal contact algebra (abbreviated as NCA) ([11, 13]) if it satisfies the following axioms (we will write $``-C$” for $``not\ C$”): (C5) If $a(-C)b$ then $a(-C)c$ and $b(-C)c^{*}$ for some $c\in B$; (C6) If $a\not=1$ then there exists $b\not=0$ such that $b(-C)a$. A normal CA is called a complete normal contact Boolean algebra or, briefly, complete normal contact algebra (abbreviated as CNCA) if it is a CCA. The notion of normal contact algebra was introduced by Fedorchuk [13] under the name Boolean $\delta$-algebra as an equivalent expression of the notion of compingent Boolean algebra of de Vries. We call such algebras $``$normal contact algebras” because they form a subclass of the class of contact algebras and naturally arise in normal Hausdorff spaces. Note that if $0\neq 1$ then the axiom (C2) follows from the axioms (C6) and (C4). For any CA $(B,C)$, we define a binary relation $``\ll_{C}$” on $B$ (called non-tangential inclusion) by $``\ a\ll_{C}b\leftrightarrow a(-C)b^{*}\ $”. Sometimes we will write simply $``\ll$” instead of $``\ll_{C}$”.
Definition 2.8 We will denote by ${\bf PLC}$ the category of all locally compact Hausdorff spaces and all perfect maps between them. Let ${\bf PAL}$ be the category whose objects are all complete LCAs and whose morphisms are all functions $\varphi:(A,\rho,{\rm I}\!{\rm B})\longrightarrow(B,\eta,{\rm I}\!{\rm B}^{% \prime})$ between the objects of ${\bf PAL}$ satisfying the following conditions: (PAL1) $\varphi(0)=0$; (PAL2) $\varphi(a\wedge b)=\varphi(a)\wedge\varphi(b)$, for all $a,b\in A$; (PAL3) If $a\in{\rm I}\!{\rm B},b\in A$ and $a\ll_{\rho}b$, then $(\varphi(a^{*}))^{*}\ll_{\eta}\varphi(b)$; (PAL4) For every $b\in{\rm I}\!{\rm B}^{\prime}$ there exists $a\in{\rm I}\!{\rm B}$ such that $b\leq\varphi(a)$; (PAL5) If $a\in{\rm I}\!{\rm B}$ then $\varphi(a)\in{\rm I}\!{\rm B}^{\prime}$; (PAL6) $\varphi(a)=\bigvee\{\varphi(b)\ |\ b\ll_{C_{\rho}}a\}$, for every $a\in A$ (see (3) for $C_{\rho}$); let the composition $``\ast$” of two morphisms $\varphi_{1}:(A_{1},\rho_{1},{\rm I}\!{\rm B}_{1})\longrightarrow(A_{2},\rho_{2% },{\rm I}\!{\rm B}_{2})$ and $\varphi_{2}:(A_{2},\rho_{2},{\rm I}\!{\rm B}_{2})\longrightarrow(A_{3},\rho_{3% },{\rm I}\!{\rm B}_{3})$ of ${\bf PAL}$ be defined by the formula $\varphi_{2}\ast\varphi_{1}=(\varphi_{2}\circ\varphi_{1})\,\tilde{}\,,$ where, for every function $\psi:(A,\rho,{\rm I}\!{\rm B})\longrightarrow(B,\eta,{\rm I}\!{\rm B}^{\prime})$ between two objects of ${\bf PAL}$, $\psi\,\tilde{}\,:(A,\rho,{\rm I}\!{\rm B})\longrightarrow(B,\eta,{\rm I}\!{\rm B% }^{\prime})$ is defined as follows: $\psi\,\tilde{}\,(a)=\bigvee\{\psi(b)\ |\ b\ll_{C_{\rho}}a\},$ for every $a\in A$. By ${\bf NAL}$ we denote the full subcategory of ${\bf PAL}$ having as objects all CNCAs (i.e., those CLCAs $(A,\rho,{\rm I}\!{\rm B})$ for which ${\rm I}\!{\rm B}=A$).
Definition 1.13 ([27]) Let $(B,\rho,{\rm I}\!{\rm B})$ be a local contact algebra. Define a binary relation $``C_{\rho}$” on $B$ by $aC_{\rho}b\ \mbox{ iff }\ a\rho b\ \mbox{ or }\ a,b\not\in{\rm I}\!{\rm B}.$ It is called the Alexandroff extension of $\rho$ relatively to the LCA $(B,\rho,{\rm I}\!{\rm B})$ (or, when there is no ambiguity, simply, the Alexandroff extension of $\rho$).
Definition 2.15 Let ${\bf PDLC}$ be the subcategory of the category ${\bf DLC}$ whose objects are all CLCAs and whose morphisms are all ${\bf DLC}$-morphisms satisfying condition (PAL5).
Definition 2.2 ([9]) Let $(A,\rho,{\rm I}\!{\rm B})$ be an LCA. An ideal $I$ of $A$ is called a $\delta$-ideal if $I\subseteq{\rm I}\!{\rm B}$ and for any $a\in I$ there exists $b\in I$ such that $a\ll_{\rho}b$. If $I_{1}$ and $I_{2}$ are two $\delta$-ideals of $(A,\rho,{\rm I}\!{\rm B})$ then we put $I_{1}\leq I_{2}$ iff $I_{1}\subseteq I_{2}$. We will denote by $(I(A,\rho,{\rm I}\!{\rm B}),\leq)$ the poset of all $\delta$-ideals of $(A,\rho,{\rm I}\!{\rm B})$.
Definition 22. The visibility graph $\mathcal{V}(P)$ of a labeled polygon $P$ is the labeled graph with the same vertex set as $P$, with $e$ as an edge of $\mathcal{V}(P)$ if $e$ is an edge or diagonal of $P$.
Definition 11. A face $f$ of $\mathcal{K}_{P}$ corresponding to a diagonalization $t\in\pi(P)$ is a maximal face if there does not exist $t^{\prime}\in\pi(P)$ such that $t\prec t^{\prime}$.
Definition 24. Two polygons $P_{1}$ and $P_{2}$ are $\mathcal{V}$-isotopic if there exists a continuous map $f:[0,1]\longrightarrow{\mathbb{R}}^{2n}$ such that $f(0)=\gamma(P_{1})$, $f(1)=\gamma(P_{2})$, and for every $t\in[0,1]$, $f(t)=\gamma(P)$ for some simple polygon $P$ where $\mathcal{V}(P)=\mathcal{V}(P_{1})$.
Definition 1. Let $\pi(P)$ be the poset of all convex diagonalizations of $P$ where for $a\prec a^{\prime}$ if $a$ is obtained from $a^{\prime}$ by adding new diagonals.1Mention of diagonals will henceforth mean noncrossing ones.
Definition 18. The secondary polytope of $\Sigma(P)$ of a polygon $P$ is the convex hull of the area vectors of all triangulations of $P$.
Definition 23. Two polygons $P_{1}$ and $P_{2}$ are $\mathcal{V}$-equivalent if $\mathcal{V}(P_{1})=\mathcal{V}(P_{2})$.
Definition 6.3 [12, 13] A family ${\cal A}$ of subsets of a topological space $X$ is said to be an almost subbase of $X$ if every element $V$ of ${\cal A}$ has a representation $V=\bigcup\{U_{n}(V)\ |\ n\in\mathbb{N}^{+}\}$, where for every $n\in\mathbb{N}^{+}$, $U_{n}(V)\subseteq U_{n+1}(V)$, $U_{2n-1}(V)$ is a zero-set in $X$ and $U_{2n}(V)$ is a cozero-set in $X$ (such a family $\{U_{n}(V)\ |\ i\in\mathbb{N}^{+}\}$ will be called an Urysohn representation of $V$), so that the family ${\cal A}\cup\{X\setminus U_{2n-1}(V)\ |\ V\in{\cal A},n\in\mathbb{N}^{+}\}$ is a subbase of $X$.
Definition 3.1 Let $(A,\rho,{\rm I}\!{\rm B})$ be an LCA and ${\cal B}$ be a subset of ${\rm I}\!{\rm B}$. Then ${\cal B}$ is called a base (or a dV-dense subset) of $(A,\rho,{\rm I}\!{\rm B})$ if for each $a,c\in{\rm I}\!{\rm B}$ such that $a\ll_{\rho}c$ there exists $b\in{\cal B}$ with $a\leq b\leq c$. The cardinal number $w(A,\rho,{\rm I}\!{\rm B})=\min\{|{\cal B}|\ |\ {\cal B}$ is a base of $(A,\rho,{\rm I}\!{\rm B})\}$ is called a weight of $(A,\rho,{\rm I}\!{\rm B})$.
Definition 1.20 Let ${\bf PZLBA}$ be the subcategory of the category ${\bf ZLBA}$, having the same objects (i.e. $|{\bf PZLBA}|=|{\bf ZLBA}|$), whose morphisms $\varphi:(A,I)\longrightarrow(B,J)$ satisfy the following additional condition: (PLBA) $\varphi(I)\subseteq J$.
Definition 4.4 A topological space $(X,{\cal T})$ is called $\pi$-semiregular if the family $RO(X)$ is a $\pi$-base of $X$.
Definition 1.22 Let ${\bf PLBA}$ be the subcategory of the category ${\bf LBA}$ whose objects are all PLBAs and whose morphisms are all ${\bf LBA}$-morphisms $\varphi:(A,I)\longrightarrow(B,J)$ between the objects of ${\bf PLBA}$ satisfying condition (PLBA).
Definition 1.1 Let ${\bf DZLC}$ (resp., ${\bf DPZLC}$) be the full subcategory of the category ${\bf DLC}$ (resp., ${\bf PAL}$) having as objects all CLCAs $(A,\rho,{\rm I}\!{\rm B})$ such that if $a,b\in{\rm I}\!{\rm B}$ and $a\ll_{\rho}b$ then there exists $c\in{\rm I}\!{\rm B}$ with $c\ll_{\rho}c$ and $a\leq c\leq b$ (see [8, Definition 1.1] for $\ll_{\rho}$).
Definition 2.1 Let $\Gamma$ be a set and $\{(A_{\gamma},\rho_{\gamma},{\rm I}\!{\rm B}_{\gamma})\ |\ \gamma\in\Gamma\}$ be a family of LCAs. Let $A=\prod\{A_{\gamma}\ |\ \gamma\in\Gamma\}$ be the product of the Boolean algebras $\{A_{\gamma}\ |\ \gamma\in\Gamma\}$ in the category ${\bf Bool}$ of Boolean algebras and Boolean homomorphisms (i.e., $A$ is the Cartesian product of the family $\{A_{\gamma}\ |\ \gamma\in\Gamma\}$, construed as a Boolean algebra with respect to the coordinate-wise operations). Let ${\rm I}\!{\rm B}=\{(b_{\gamma})_{\gamma\in\Gamma}\in\prod\{{\rm I}\!{\rm B}_{% \gamma}\ |\ \gamma\in\Gamma\}\ |\ |\{\gamma\in\Gamma\ |\ b_{\gamma}\neq 0\}|<% \aleph_{0}\}$, where $\prod\{{\rm I}\!{\rm B}_{\gamma}\ |\ \gamma\in\Gamma\}$ is the Cartesian product of the family $\{{\rm I}\!{\rm B}_{\gamma}\ |\ \gamma\in\Gamma\}$ (in other words, ${\rm I}\!{\rm B}$ is the $\sigma$-product of the family $\{{\rm I}\!{\rm B}_{\gamma}\ |\ \gamma\in\Gamma\}$ with base point $0=(0_{\gamma})_{\gamma\in\Gamma}$). For any two points $a=(a_{\gamma})_{\gamma\in\Gamma}\in A$ and $b=(b_{\gamma})_{\gamma\in\Gamma}\in A$, set $a\rho b$ if there exists $\gamma\in\Gamma$ such that $a_{\gamma}\rho_{\gamma}b_{\gamma}$. Then the triple $(A,\rho,{\rm I}\!{\rm B})$ is called a product of the family of LCAs $\{(A_{\gamma},\rho_{\gamma},{\rm I}\!{\rm B}_{\gamma})\ |\ \gamma\in\Gamma\}$. We will write $(A,\rho,{\rm I}\!{\rm B})=\prod\{(A_{\gamma},\rho_{\gamma},{\rm I}\!{\rm B}_{% \gamma})\ |\ \gamma\in\Gamma\}$.
Definition 4.8 Let $f:(X,{\cal T})\longrightarrow(Y,{\cal O})$ be a continuous map. We will say that $f$ is a $\pi$-map if it is a closed irreducible map. The map $f$ is called a quasi-$\pi$-map (respectively, an MR-map) if $\mbox{{\rm cl}}(f(X))=Y$ and for every $U\in{\cal T}\setminus\{\emptyset\}$ (respectively, for every $U\in RO(X)\setminus\{\emptyset\}$) we have that $\mbox{{\rm int}}(f^{\sharp}(U))\neq\emptyset$.
Definition 1.12 An LBA $(B,I)$ is called a ZLB-algebra (briefly, ZLBA) if, for every $J\in Si(I)$, the join $\bigvee_{B}J$($=\bigvee_{B}\{a\ |\ a\in J\}$) exists. Let ${\bf ZLBA}$ be the full subcategory of the category ${\bf LBA}$ having as objects all ZLBAs.
Definition 7.1 Let $(A,\rho,{\rm I}\!{\rm B})$ be an LCA. A pair $(\varphi,(A^{\prime},\rho^{\prime},{\rm I}\!{\rm B}^{\prime}))$ is called an LCA-completion of the LCA $(A,\rho,{\rm I}\!{\rm B})$ if $(A^{\prime},\rho^{\prime},{\rm I}\!{\rm B}^{\prime})$ is a CLCA, $\varphi$ is an LCA-embedding (see [8, Definition 1.11]) of $(A,\rho,{\rm I}\!{\rm B})$ in $(A^{\prime},\rho^{\prime},{\rm I}\!{\rm B}^{\prime})$, and $\varphi({\rm I}\!{\rm B})$ is a dV-dense subset of $(A^{\prime},\rho^{\prime},{\rm I}\!{\rm B}^{\prime})$ (see 3.1 for the last notion). Two LCA-completions $(\varphi,(A^{\prime},\rho^{\prime},{\rm I}\!{\rm B}^{\prime}))$ and $(\psi,(A^{\prime\prime},\rho^{\prime\prime},{\rm I}\!{\rm B}^{\prime\prime}))$ of a local contact algebra $(A,\rho,{\rm I}\!{\rm B})$ are said to be equivalent if there exists an LCA-isomorphism $\eta:(A^{\prime},\rho^{\prime},{\rm I}\!{\rm B}^{\prime})\longrightarrow(A^{% \prime\prime},\rho^{\prime\prime},{\rm I}\!{\rm B}^{\prime\prime})$ such that $\psi=\eta\circ\varphi$.
Definition 4.1 Let $(A,\leq)$ be a poset. We set $\pi w(A,\leq)=\min\{|{\cal B}|\ |\ {\cal B}$ is dense in $(A,\leq)\}$; the cardinal number $\pi w(A,\leq)$ is called a $\pi$-weight of the poset $(A,\leq)$.
Definition 1.3 A pair $(A,I)$, where $A$ is a Boolean algebra and $I$ is an ideal of $A$ (possibly non proper) which is dense in $A$ (shortly, dense ideal), is called a local Boolean algebra (abbreviated as LBA). An LBA $(A,I)$ is called a prime local Boolean algebra (abbreviated as PLBA) if $I=A$ or $I$ is a prime ideal of $A$. Two LBAs $(A,I)$ and $(B,J)$ are said to be isomorphic if there exists a Boolean isomorphism $\varphi:A\longrightarrow B$ such that $\varphi(I)=J$. Let ${\bf LBA}$ be the category whose objects are all LBAs and whose morphisms are all functions $\varphi:(B,I)\longrightarrow(B_{1},I_{1})$ between the objects of ${\bf LBA}$ such that $\varphi:B\longrightarrow B_{1}$ is a Boolean homomorphism satisfying the following condition: (LBA) For every $b\in I_{1}$ there exists $a\in I$ such that $b\leq\varphi(a)$; let the composition between the morphisms of ${\bf LBA}$ be the usual composition between functions, and the ${\bf LBA}$-identities be the identity functions.
Definition 6.2. Suppose $s$ is an $\!\Omega_{\D}\!$-term of arity $\gamma,$ and $P$ a $\!\theta\!$-indexed precoalgebra of type $\Omega_{\D}$ in a category $\mathbf{A}.$ For $j\leq k\in\theta,$ a $\!(j,k)\!$-instance of $s$ in $P$ (unique, by the next lemma, if it exists for the given $k,$ $j$ and $s)$ will mean a map $(P_{k})_{\mathrm{base}}\ \to\ \coprod_{\gamma}\,(P_{j})_{\mathrm{base}}\kern 0% .833pt,$ arising under the following recursive construction: If $s$ is the $\!\iota\!$-th projection map for some $\iota\in\gamma,$ then for all $j\leq k\in\theta,$ the $\!(j,k)\!$-instance of $s$ is given by $q^{(P_{j})_{\mathrm{base}}}_{\gamma,\kern 0.833pt\iota}\kern 2.5pt{% \scriptstyle\circ}\kern 2.5pt\nolinebreak[3](p_{j,\kern 0.833ptk})_{\mathrm{% base}}\kern 0.833pt.$ (In particular, taking $j=k,$ the $\!(k,k)\!$-instance of the $\!\iota\!$-th projection $s$ is the $\!\iota\!$-th coprojection, $q^{(P_{k})_{\mathrm{base}}}_{\gamma,\kern 0.833pt\iota}.)$ If $s$ has the form $\alpha(u_{0},u_{1},\dots),$ where $\alpha\in\Omega_{\D},$ and $(u_{0},u_{1},\dots)$ is an $\!\ari(\alpha)\!$-tuple of $\!\Omega_{\D}\!$-terms (some or all of which may be projections and/or primitive operations), each of arity $\gamma,$ and if for some $i\leq j<k\in\theta$ we have, for each $\iota\in\ari(\alpha),$ an $\!(i,j)\!$-instance of $u_{\iota},$ which we denote $U_{\iota}:(P_{j})_{\mathrm{base}}\to\coprod_{\gamma}\,(P_{i})_{\mathrm{base}},$ then an $\!(i,k)\!$-instance of $s$ is given by the composite map $(\bigvee_{\kern-1.0pt\iota\in\ari(\alpha)}\kern 0.833ptU_{\iota})\kern 2.5pt{% \scriptstyle\circ}\kern 2.5pt\nolinebreak[3]\alpha^{P_{j+1}}\kern 2.5pt{% \scriptstyle\circ}\kern 2.5pt\nolinebreak[3](p_{j+1,\kern 0.833ptk})_{\mathrm{% base}}:\lx@parboxnewline[.17em]\hskip 40.0pt(P_{k})_{\mathrm{base}}\,\to\,(P_{% j+1})_{\mathrm{base}}\,\to\,(P_{j+1})_{\alpha}=\coprod_{\ari(\alpha)}\,(P_{j})% _{\mathrm{base}}\,\to\,\coprod_{\gamma}\,(P_{i})_{\mathrm{base}}\kern 0.833pt.$
Definition 4.1. By a $\!\D\!$-pseudocoalgebra in a category $\bf{A},$ we shall mean a $\!4\!$-tuple $S\ =\ (S_{\mathrm{base}}\kern 0.833pt,\ (S_{\alpha})_{\alpha\in\Omega_{\D}},\ % (c^{S}_{\alpha,\kern 0.833pt\iota})_{\alpha\in\Omega_{\D},\,\kern 0.833pt\iota% \in\ari(\alpha)},\ (\alpha^{S})_{\alpha\in\Omega_{\D}}),$ where $S_{\mathrm{base}}$ and the $S_{\alpha}$ are objects of $\mathbf{A}$ (the “base object” and the “pseudocopower objects”), and for each $\alpha\in\Omega_{\D},$ $\alpha^{S}$ (the $\!\alpha\!$-th “pseudo-co-operation”) and the $c^{S}_{\alpha,\kern 0.833pt\iota}$ (the “pseudocoprojections”, one for each $\iota\in\ari(\alpha))$ are morphisms $S_{\mathrm{base}}\to S_{\alpha}.$ A morphism of $\!\D\!$-pseudocoalgebras $f:S\to S^{\prime}$ will mean a family of morphisms $f_{\mathrm{base}}:S_{\mathrm{base}}\to S^{\prime}_{\mathrm{base}}\kern 0.833pt,$ and $f_{\alpha}:S_{\alpha}\to S^{\prime}_{\alpha}$ $(\alpha\in\Omega_{\D})$ which make commuting squares with the $c^{S}_{\alpha,\kern 0.833pt\iota}$ and $c^{S^{\prime}}_{\alpha,\kern 0.833pt\iota},$ and with the $\alpha^{S}$ and $\alpha^{S^{\prime}}.$ The category of $\!\D\!$-pseudocoalgebras in $\mathbf{A}$ will be denoted $\mathbf{Pseudocoalg}(\mathbf{A},\nolinebreak[2]\D).$
Definition 11.2. $|R\kern 0.833pt|\subseteq(P^{\prime}_{2})_{\mathrm{base}}$ will denote the subsemigroup of elements at which the maps (54), (55) and (56) all agree.
Definition 4.3. A morphism of coalgebras will be called surjective if it is surjective on underlying $\!\mathbf{C}\kern 0.5pt\!$-objects. If $f:R\to R^{\prime}$ is a surjective morphism in $(\mathbf{Coalg}(\mathbf{C}\kern 0.5pt,\nolinebreak[2]\D)\downarrow S),$ for some pseudocoalgebra $S,$ then $R^{\prime}$ (given with the map $f$ from $R)$ will be called an image coalgebra of $R$ over $S.$ To avoid dealing with the non-small set of isomorphic copies of each such image, we shall call an image coalgebra $R^{\prime}$ of $R$ standard if the map $||R\kern 0.833pt||\to||R^{\prime}||$ is the canonical map from a set to its set of equivalence classes under an equivalence relation. A coalgebra $R$ over $S$ will be called strongly quasifinal over $S$ if the only surjective morphisms out of $R$ in $(\mathbf{Coalg}(\mathbf{C}\kern 0.5pt,\nolinebreak[2]\D)\downarrow S)$ are the isomorphisms.
Definition 3.5. A subalgebra $A$ of a $\!\mathbf{C}\kern 0.5pt\!$-algebra $B$ will be called copower-pure if for every cardinal $\kappa,$ the induced map $\coprod_{\kappa}A\ \to\ \coprod_{\kappa}B$ is one-to-one. When this holds, we shall often identify $\coprod_{\kappa}A$ with its image in $\coprod_{\kappa}B\kern 0.833pt.$
