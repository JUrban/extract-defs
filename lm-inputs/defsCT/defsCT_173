Definition Two smooth charted (oriented) 2-vector bundles $\mathcal{E}_{i},i=0,1$ over $X$ are equivalent if they are cobordant. I.e. there exist a smooth charted (oriented) 2-vector bundle $\mathcal{E}$ over $X\times[0,1]$ such that $\mathcal{E}_{\mid X\times\{t\}}=\mathcal{E}_{t}$ for $t=0,1$. Here restriction uses restriction of the ordered open cover, which removes the sets, and their indices, with empty intersection with $X\times\{i\}$, and the smooth coherency maps are assumed to be constant in the $t$ direction close to the boundary of $I$ - so as to make composition of bordisms well-defined in the smooth category. $\blacklozenge$
Definition We define the strict monoidal functor $\operatorname{Dger}$ from $\mathrm{OGl}_{n}(\mathcal{V})$ to $\mathcal{L}_{+}^{*}$ as the composite $p\circ\operatorname{ODet}$. $\blacklozenge$
Definition Let $\mathcal{L}^{*}$ be the full subcategory of invertible objects in $\mathcal{L}$ with respect to the product $\otimes$. I.e. using the identification in definition \thechapter we see $\displaystyle\operatorname{Mor}(\mathcal{L}^{*})=\{\pm 1\}\times\mathbb{C}^{*}.$ This is obviously a permutative category with respect to $\otimes$, and since the twist for $\otimes$ on the object pair $-1$ and $-1$ is not the identity we still retain part of the non-trivial coherency structure from $\mathcal{L}$ in $\mathcal{L}^{*}$. Also define $\mathcal{L}_{+}^{*}$ to be the sub-category with the single object $1$ and $\mathbb{C}^{*}$ as automorphisms. This is the usual way of identifying a group with a category, however, we have also given it the canonical permutative structure using that the product is Abelian, and it also comes with its inclusion of permutative categories into $(\mathcal{L},\otimes)$ as the “positive” units. $\blacklozenge$
Definition For any bipermutative category $\mathcal{B}$ define $\operatorname{M}_{n}(\mathcal{B})$ as the category with • objects $n$ by $n$ matrices $E=(E_{ij})_{i,j=1}^{n}$ of objects in $\mathcal{B}$, and • morphisms $n$ by $n$ matrices $\phi=(\phi_{ij})_{i,j=1}^{n}$ of morphisms in $\mathcal{B}$, with the obvious sources and targets. We define a monoidal product on $\operatorname{M}_{n}(\mathcal{B})$ by $\displaystyle\cdot\colon\operatorname{M}_{n}(\mathcal{B})\times\operatorname{M% }_{n}(\mathcal{B})\to\operatorname{M}_{n}(\mathcal{B})$ by standard matrix multiplication formula: $\displaystyle(E\cdot F)_{ik}=\bigoplus_{j=1}^{n}(E_{ij}\otimes F_{jk}).$ We need not specify parenthesis because $\oplus$ is strictly associative. This does, however, not in general produce a strictly associative product because this would imply both distributive laws in $\mathcal{B}$ holding strictly. But there are obvious coherency isomorphisms induced from the coherency isomorphisms in $\mathcal{B}$ making this a monoidal category - with a strict unit. $\blacklozenge$
Definition Let $M$ be a smooth para-compact manifold with smooth partitions of unity, let $(\mathcal{B},\cdot)$ be any smooth monoidal category with discrete objects, and let $\mathcal{(U,J})$ be an ordered open cover. A smooth principle $\mathcal{B}$-bundle is [1)] 1. for each $\alpha<\beta$ in $\mathcal{J}$ an object $E^{{\alpha\beta}}$ in $\mathcal{B}$, such that for each $\alpha<\beta<\gamma$ we have $\displaystyle E^{{\alpha\beta}}\cdot E^{{\beta\gamma}}=E^{{\alpha\gamma}}$ on the level of objects, and 2. for each $\alpha<\beta<\gamma$ we have smooth maps $\displaystyle\phi^{{\alpha\beta\gamma}}\colon U_{{\alpha\beta\gamma}}\to% \operatorname{Mor}(E^{{\alpha\beta}}\cdot E^{{\beta\gamma}},E^{{\alpha\gamma}}% )\qquad(=\operatorname{Aut}(E^{{\alpha\gamma}})),$ called the coherency maps such that 3. the diagram Here ${\underline{\text{c}}}^{{\alpha\beta\gamma\delta}}$ denotes the associator for the product $\cdot$ in $\mathcal{B}$ related to the two different choices of parenthesis. The diagram may be thought of as a cocycle condition. $\blacklozenge$ Definition Let $n\in\mathbb{N}_{0}$ be a non-negative integer. A smooth charted (oriented) 2-vector bundle $\mathcal{E}$ of rank $n$ over $M$ is a principal $\mathrm{Gl}_{n}(\mathcal{V})$-bundle ($\mathrm{OGl}_{n}(\mathcal{V})$-bundle). $\blacklozenge$ This is slightly different than the definition in [K-theory/0629], but in the unoriented case if we ignore the smoothness condition then up to the equivalence defined below (taken from [2-cat]) this provides the same equivalence classes. Definition Two smooth charted (oriented) 2-vector bundles $\mathcal{E}_{i},i=0,1$ over $X$ are equivalent if they are cobordant. I.e. there exist a smooth charted (oriented) 2-vector bundle $\mathcal{E}$ over $X\times[0,1]$ such that $\mathcal{E}_{\mid X\times\{t\}}=\mathcal{E}_{t}$ for $t=0,1$. Here restriction uses restriction of the ordered open cover, which removes the sets, and their indices, with empty intersection with $X\times\{i\}$, and the smooth coherency maps are assumed to be constant in the $t$ direction close to the boundary of $I$ - so as to make composition of bordisms well-defined in the smooth category. $\blacklozenge$ We use this definition, as opposed to the one in [K-theory/0629], even though it is less explicit, because it is easier to work with. Definition We say that a smooth charted 2-vector bundle is orientable if it is equivalent to a smooth charted 2-vector bundle which is the image of a smooth charted oriented 2-vector bundle under the strict monoidal functor $P_{\mathrm{Gl}_{n}(\mathcal{V})}$. $\blacklozenge$ Note that the definition of $\mathcal{B}$-bundle is obviously functorial with respect to strict monoidal functors, because these preserve products, associators, and compositions. This even works in the smooth setting because the functor is in fact also smooth. Lemma For a smooth charted 2-vector bundle the sign $\displaystyle\operatorname{sgn}({\underline{\text{c}}}^{{\alpha\beta\gamma% \delta}})$ of the determinants of the associators defines a 3-cocycle in the $\check{\text{C}}$ech complex $\check{C}^{*}(\mathcal{U},\{\pm 1\})$. The represented class in $\check{\text{C}}$ech cohomology depends only on the equivalence class of the 2-vector bundle. Furthermore, this class is zero if and only if the vector bundle is orientable. $\blacklozenge$ Proof: This is virtually the same argument as in construction \thechapter. Again we know from the Lane-Stasheff pentagon axiom that $\displaystyle{\underline{\text{c}}}^{{\alpha\gamma\delta\varepsilon}}\circ{% \underline{\text{c}}}^{{\alpha\beta\gamma\varepsilon}}=\left\lparen{\underline% {\text{c}}}^{{\alpha\beta\gamma\delta}}\cdot\operatorname{Id}_{E^{{\delta% \varepsilon}}}\right\rparen\circ{\underline{\text{c}}}^{{\alpha\beta\delta% \varepsilon}}\circ\left\lparen\operatorname{Id}_{E^{{\alpha\beta}}}\cdot{% \underline{\text{c}}}^{{\beta\gamma\delta\varepsilon}}\right\rparen.$ Taking $\operatorname{Det}$, and again using its properties (see equation LABEL:sgnprop), we get $\displaystyle\operatorname{sgn}\left\lparen{\underline{\text{c}}}^{{\alpha% \gamma\delta\varepsilon}}\right\rparen\operatorname{sgn}\left\lparen{% \underline{\text{c}}}^{{\alpha\beta\gamma\varepsilon}}\right\rparen=% \operatorname{sgn}\left\lparen{\underline{\text{c}}}^{{\alpha\beta\gamma\delta% }}\right\rparen\operatorname{sgn}\left\lparen{\underline{\text{c}}}^{{\alpha% \beta\delta\varepsilon}}\right\rparen\operatorname{sgn}\left\lparen{\underline% {\text{c}}}^{{\beta\gamma\delta\varepsilon}}\right\rparen,$ which is the co-cycle condition. Obviously the associated homology class only depends on the equivalence class since the inclusions of $X\times\{i\}$ into $X\times[0,1]$ is a homotopy equivalence. This class is zero if and only if there is a refinement $\mathcal{(U,J)}$ of the ordered open cover such that we have a chain $\alpha$ in $\check{C}^{2}(\mathcal{U^{\prime}},\{\pm 1\})$ s.t. $\partial\alpha=\operatorname{Det}({\underline{\text{c}}})$, but such a choice exactly corresponds to a lift of the smooth coherency maps $\phi^{{\alpha\beta\gamma}}$ to $(\phi^{{\alpha\beta\gamma}},\alpha)$ in the oriented category, such that they satisfy diagram 5 also in the oriented category. $\square$ Remark This last part also tells us how many different choices of orientations there are on an orientable 2-vector bundle. $\blacklozenge$ Definition A charted gerbe is a smooth charted $\mathcal{L}_{+}^{*}$-bundle. $\blacklozenge$ Note that since $\mathcal{L}_{+}^{*}$ has one object with automorphisms $\mathbb{C}^{*}$ and is strictly associative this is the same as having a standard 2-cocycle with coefficients in $\mathbb{C}^{*}$, and thus these are classified up to equivalence by the third cohomology class of the base manifold. Construction We wish to construct an inclusion of gerbes into oriented 2-vector bundles, which is a lift of the usual inclusion of gerbes into 2-vector bundles. We start by describing the usual inclusion on the level of categories. A charted gerbe is the same as a charted $\mathrm{Sl}_{1}(\mathcal{L})$-bundle and it is also the same as a charted $\mathrm{Sl}_{1}(\mathcal{V})$-bundle. The latter seen as just a monoidal category has a natural inclusion into $\mathrm{Gl}_{1}(\mathcal{V})$, which in turn has a natural inclusion into $\mathrm{Gl}_{n}(\mathcal{V})$ by block sum with the $(n-1)\times(n-1)$ identity matrix on objects, and block sum with the identity morphism on this matrix on the morphisms. Here we call the matrix, which is the unit in the monoidal structure, the identity matrix, and of course this has an identity morphism. The explicit description of this object is a matrix with the object $\mathbb{C}\in\mathcal{V}$ on the diagonal and the object $\mathbb{C}^{0}\in\mathcal{V}$ every where else. The latter object has only the identity morphism but $\mathbb{C}$ of course has other morphisms, and the identity on the matrix is just the identity in each entry. The construction of block sum is easily seen to be a strict monoidal functor $\displaystyle\mathrm{Gl}_{n}(\mathcal{V})\times\mathrm{Gl}_{m}(\mathcal{V})\to% \mathrm{Gl}_{n+m}(\mathcal{V}).$ In fact it is a strict bimonoidal functor on the categories of all matrices - not just the weakly invertible, but we wont use this. This inclusion of gerbes may be lifted to the oriented category $\mathrm{OGl}_{n}(\mathcal{V})$. by using the strict monoidal functor $\displaystyle\colon\mathrm{Gl}_{1}(\mathcal{V})\to\mathrm{OGl}_{1}(\mathcal{V}),$ which simply puts the sign $1$ on all morphisms. This is indeed strict monoidal since the associator in $\mathrm{Gl}_{1}(\mathcal{V})$ is the associator for $\otimes$ in $\mathcal{V}$ on the object $\mathbb{C}$, hence it is the identity and has sign 1. To generalize the block sum we need to incorporate the sign. So we define the functor $\displaystyle S\colon\mathrm{OGl}_{n}(\mathcal{V})\times\mathrm{OGl}_{m}(% \mathcal{V})\to\mathrm{OGl}_{n+m}(\mathcal{V})$ by block sum on objects, block sum on the first factor of the morphisms, and by multiplying the signs on the second factor. This is obviously a product preserving functor (by ignoring the coherencies and using weak strictness on the second factor), and for it to be strict monoidal it has to preserve the associators. In the first factor of the morphisms this follows because the above unoriented block sum is strict monoidal, so we only need to check the sign in the second factor. This depends on the fact that we restricted to the weakly invertible matrices meaning that $\displaystyle\operatorname{Det}(S({\underline{\text{c}}}_{n},{\underline{\text% {c}}}_{m}))$ $\displaystyle=\operatorname{Det}({\underline{\text{c}}}_{n})\otimes% \operatorname{Det}({\underline{\text{c}}}_{m})=(\pm 1,\operatorname{sgn}({% \underline{\text{c}}}_{n}))\otimes(\pm,\operatorname{sgn}({\underline{\text{c}% }}_{m}))=$ $\displaystyle=(\pm 1,\operatorname{sgn}({\underline{\text{c}}}_{n})% \operatorname{sgn}({\underline{\text{c}}}_{m})).$ So the sign of the block sum of two associators is the product of the signs of the associators, which is precisely what we need. The resulting inclusion functor from $\mathcal{L}_{+}^{*}$ to $\mathrm{OGl}_{n}(\mathcal{V})$ will be denoted $i$. The unoriented inclusion described above is thus the composition of functors $P_{\mathrm{Gl}_{n}(\mathcal{V})}\circ i$. $\blacklozenge$ Construction In [K-theory/0629] and [2-cat] it is described how to construct a simplicial classifying category $B\mathcal{B}$ of a monoidal category $\mathcal{B}$ such that the geometric realizations of the nerves of the categories $\displaystyle\lvert B\mathcal{B}\rvert$ is a classifying space of $\mathcal{B}$-bundles. There are certain conditions that $\mathcal{B}$ must satisfy, but the categories we work with here satisfy all these. It is used repeatedly in the following that this construction is functorial from the category of monoidal categories and strict monoidal functors. Since $\mathcal{L}_{+}^{*}$ has one object with automorphisms $\mathbb{C}^{*}$ it follows that $\lvert B\mathcal{L}_{+}^{*}\rvert$ is a $K(\mathbb{Z},3)$ and in [MR2466184] it is proven that the map $\displaystyle\lvert B(P_{\mathrm{Gl}_{n}(\mathcal{V})}\circ i)\rvert_{*}\colon% \pi_{3}(\lvert B\mathcal{L}_{+}^{*}\rvert)\to\pi_{3}(\lvert B\mathrm{Gl}_{n}(% \mathcal{V})\rvert)$ sends the canonical generator to an element divisible by 2 modulo torsion. They use this as an obstruction to creating a retraction back to $\lvert B\mathcal{L}_{+}^{*}\rvert\simeq K(\mathbb{Z},3)$. Or more specifically a determinant like map to $\lvert B\mathrm{Gl}_{1}(ku)\rvert=B(\{\-1,1\}\times BU)$, which composed with the canonical map to $K(\mathbb{Z},3)$ would yield such a retraction. The point of the orientations is that the the monoidal functor $\operatorname{ODet}$ provides a retraction: $\displaystyle\lvert B\operatorname{ODet}\rvert\colon\lvert B\mathrm{OGl}_{n}(% \mathcal{V})\rvert\to\lvert B\mathcal{L}^{*}\rvert\simeq K(\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb% {Z},1)\times\lvert B\mathcal{L}_{+}^{*}\rvert\to\lvert B\mathcal{L}_{+}^{*}\rvert$ of $\lvert Bi\rvert$. Here the latter map is the projection and the identification $\displaystyle\lvert B\mathcal{L}^{*}\rvert\simeq K(\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z},1)% \times\lvert B\mathcal{L}_{+}^{*}\rvert$ is due to the fact that the monoidal structure in $\mathcal{L}^{*}$ is strictly associative, and so the $A_{\infty}$ structure splits. This splitting can be described using monoidal functors in the following way: we have the inclusion $\displaystyle\mathcal{L}_{+}^{*}\to\mathcal{L}^{*},$ which is a strict symmetric monoidal functor, and we have a left inverse (or projection) $\displaystyle p\colon\mathcal{L}^{*}\to\mathcal{L}_{+}^{*}$ given by $p(d,a)=(1,a^{d})$ this is not symmetric monoidal because the symmetry on $-1$ is not the identity. It is, however, strict monoidal because $\displaystyle p((d,a)\otimes(e,b))$ $\displaystyle=p(de,a^{e}b^{d})=(1,a^{d}b^{e})=$ $\displaystyle=(1,a^{d})\otimes(1,b^{e})=p((d,a))\otimes p((e,b)),$ and all associators are identities. We now see that $p\circ\operatorname{ODet}$ is a strict monoidal functor and right inverse to the strict monoidal functor $i$. Definition We define the strict monoidal functor $\operatorname{Dger}$ from $\mathrm{OGl}_{n}(\mathcal{V})$ to $\mathcal{L}_{+}^{*}$ as the composite $p\circ\operatorname{ODet}$. $\blacklozenge$ $\blacklozenge$ We thus conclude that we have removed the obstruction and that the half magnetic monopole in [MR2466184] must be an unorientable 2-vector bundle. Chapter \thechapter Connective structures In [MR2362847] Brylinski defines gerbes over a space $X$ and classify their equivalence classes by $H^{3}(X,\mathbb{Z})$. He also gives an example in chapter 7 of how to get from a charted gerbe to his definition of a gerbe, which is easily generalized. He defines the notion of a connective structure on a gerbe, and in the charted case this corresponds to having Hermitian connections $\nabla_{{\alpha\beta}}$ on the trivial line bundles $\displaystyle L_{{\alpha\beta}}=U_{{\alpha\beta}}\times\mathbb{C}$ such that the coherency maps $\phi^{{\alpha\beta\gamma}}\colon\mathbb{C}^{*}\to\mathbb{C}^{*}$ describes isometries of line bundles $\displaystyle L_{{\alpha\beta}\mid U_{\alpha\beta\gamma}}\otimes L_{{\beta% \gamma}\mid U_{\alpha\beta\gamma}}\to L_{{\alpha\gamma}\mid U_{\alpha\beta% \gamma}}.$ We now generalize this notion of connective structures to 2-vector bundles. Definition A connective structure $\nabla$ on a smooth charted two vector bundle $\mathcal{E}$ is for each $\alpha<\beta$ in $\mathcal{J}$ a choice of an $n\times n$-matrix of connections $\nabla^{{\alpha\beta}}$ on the matrix of trivial bundles $\displaystyle U_{{\alpha\beta}}\times E^{{\alpha\beta}},$ such that for all $\alpha<\beta<\gamma$ the pullback $(\phi^{{\alpha\beta\gamma}})^{*}\nabla^{{\alpha\gamma}}$ is the same connection as the one induced from the product $E^{{\alpha\beta}}\cdot E^{{\beta\gamma}}$ of matrices in $\operatorname{M}_{n}(\mathcal{V})$. This we write as $\displaystyle(\phi^{{\alpha\beta\gamma}})^{*}\nabla^{{\alpha\gamma}}=\nabla^{{% \alpha\beta}}\cdot\nabla^{{\beta\gamma}},$ and diagram 5 tells us that $\displaystyle(\phi^{{\alpha\gamma\delta}-1})^{*}[(\phi^{{\alpha\beta\gamma}-1}% )^{*}(\nabla^{{\alpha\beta}}\cdot\nabla^{{\beta\gamma}})\cdot\nabla^{{\gamma% \delta}}]=$ $\displaystyle(\phi^{{\alpha\beta\delta}-1})^{*}[\nabla^{{\alpha\beta}}\cdot(% \phi^{{\beta\gamma\delta}-1})^{*}(\nabla^{{\beta\gamma}}\cdot\nabla^{{\gamma% \delta}})].$ In light of this we define for any such connections the convenient associative “product” $\displaystyle\nabla^{{\alpha\beta}}{{\bullet}}\nabla^{{\beta\gamma}}=((\phi^{{% \alpha\beta\gamma}})^{-1})^{*}(\nabla^{{\alpha\beta}}\cdot\nabla^{{\beta\gamma% }}),$ which is a connection on $U_{\alpha\beta\gamma}\times E^{{\alpha\gamma}}$. In this notation the requirement for a family of connections to be a connective structure is the cocycle condition with respect to ${{\bullet}}$. $\blacklozenge$ This product behaves well under smooth convex combinations: that is $\displaystyle(\psi_{1}\nabla_{1}^{{\alpha\beta}}+\psi_{2}\nabla_{2}^{{\alpha% \beta}}){{\bullet}}(\psi^{\prime}_{1}\nabla_{1}^{{\beta\gamma}}+\psi_{2}^{% \prime}\nabla_{2}^{{\beta\gamma}})=$ $\displaystyle=$ $\displaystyle\psi_{1}\psi_{1}^{\prime}\nabla_{1}^{{\alpha\beta}}{{\bullet}}% \nabla_{1}^{{\beta\gamma}}+\psi_{2}\psi_{1}^{\prime}\nabla_{2}^{{\alpha\beta}}% {{\bullet}}\nabla_{1}^{{\beta\gamma}}+\psi_{1}\psi_{2}^{\prime}\nabla_{1}^{{% \alpha\beta}}{{\bullet}}\nabla_{2}^{{\beta\gamma}}+\psi_{2}\psi_{2}^{\prime}% \nabla_{2}^{{\alpha\beta}}{{\bullet}}\nabla_{2}^{{\beta\gamma}},$ and $\displaystyle(\psi_{1}\nabla_{1}^{{\alpha\beta}}+\psi_{2}\nabla_{2}^{{\alpha% \beta}}){{\bullet}}(\psi_{1}\nabla_{1}^{{\beta\gamma}}+\psi_{2}\nabla_{2}^{{% \beta\gamma}})=\psi_{1}\nabla_{1}^{{\alpha\beta}}{{\bullet}}\nabla_{1}^{{\beta% \gamma}}+\psi_{2}\nabla_{2}^{{\alpha\beta}}{{\bullet}}\nabla_{2}^{{\beta\gamma}}$ are true for any smooth functions $\psi_{1}+\psi_{2}=1$ and $\psi_{1}^{\prime}+\psi_{2}^{\prime}=1$. Indeed, they are true for the tensor product of vector bundles, and this we may use on each direct summand of each entry in the matrix, and pullback preserves convex combinations. Lemma Let $\mathcal{E}$ be any smooth charted 2-vector bundle. After a possible elementary refinement $\mathcal{E}$ has a connective structure and such a choice is a contractible choice. $\blacklozenge$ Proof: For any partially ordered set $\mathcal{J}$ define $\displaystyle\mathcal{J}_{\alpha}^{\beta}=\{\alpha_{0}<\cdots<\alpha_{k}\mid k% \in\mathbb{N},\alpha_{0}=\alpha,\alpha_{k}=\beta\}$ the finite sequences in $\mathcal{J}$ connecting $\alpha$ and $\beta$. By para-compactness we may assume after refinement that C1) the cover $(\mathcal{U},\mathcal{J})$ is locally finite. Again using para-compactness we shrink $(\mathcal{U,J})$ to an ordered open cover $(\mathcal{U}^{\prime},\mathcal{J})$ (with carrier function the identity), such that C2) for any $\alpha\in\mathcal{J}$ we have the closure of $U^{\prime}_{\alpha}$ contained in $U_{\alpha}$. Now we use existence of smooth partition of unity to get smooth functions $\displaystyle\psi_{\alpha}\colon M\to[0,1]$ with $\psi_{\alpha\mid U^{\prime}_{\alpha}}=1$ and $\psi_{\alpha\mid M-U_{\alpha}}=0$. Choose any connections $\nabla^{{\alpha\beta}}_{0}$ on $\displaystyle U_{\alpha\beta}\times E^{\alpha\beta}.$ For each $\overrightarrow{\alpha}\in\mathcal{J}_{\alpha}^{\beta}$ we have a connection $\displaystyle\nabla^{\overrightarrow{\alpha}}_{0}=\nabla^{\alpha_{0}\alpha_{1}% }_{0}{{\bullet}}\cdots{{\bullet}}\nabla^{\alpha_{i}\alpha_{i+1}}_{0}{{\bullet}% }\cdots{{\bullet}}\nabla^{\alpha_{k-1}\alpha_{k}}_{0}$ defined on ${U_{\alpha_{0}\dots\alpha_{k}}}\subset U_{{\alpha\beta}}$. We will smoothly interpolate between these. So we define the weights: $\displaystyle\psi_{\overrightarrow{\alpha}}=\smashoperator[]{\prod_{i=0}^{k-1}% }\left\lparen\psi_{\alpha_{i}}\psi_{\alpha_{i+1}}\smashoperator[]{\prod_{% \alpha_{i}<\gamma<\alpha_{i+1}}^{}}(1-\psi_{\gamma})\right\rparen,$ for each $\overrightarrow{\alpha}\in\mathcal{J}_{\alpha}^{\beta}$. The product is well-defined and smooth because C1) implies locally finiteness of the second product. Notice that $\displaystyle\psi_{\overrightarrow{\alpha}}=\psi_{\overrightarrow{\alpha}_{1}}% \psi_{\overrightarrow{\alpha}_{2}},$ when $\alpha<\beta<\gamma$, $\overrightarrow{\alpha}_{1}\in\mathcal{J}_{\alpha}^{\beta}$, $\overrightarrow{\alpha}_{2}\in\mathcal{J}_{\beta}^{\gamma}$, and $\overrightarrow{\alpha}\in\mathcal{J}_{\alpha}^{\gamma}$ is the obvious concatenation of $\overrightarrow{\alpha}_{1}$ and $\overrightarrow{\alpha}_{2}$. On the sets $U^{\prime}_{\alpha\beta}\subset U_{\alpha\beta}$ we then define $\displaystyle\nabla^{{\alpha\beta}}=\quad\frac{{\sum_{\overrightarrow{\alpha}% \in\mathcal{J}_{\alpha}^{\beta}}}(\psi_{\overrightarrow{\alpha}}\nabla_{0}^{% \overrightarrow{\alpha}})}{{\sum_{\overrightarrow{\alpha}\in\mathcal{J}_{% \alpha}^{\beta}}}(\psi_{\overrightarrow{\alpha}})},$ This is well-defined and smooth because; • the weights in the sum are 0 when the connections are not defined, • C1) implies that the sums are locally finite, • and $\psi_{\overrightarrow{\alpha}}$ is non-zero when we include the $\gamma$’s with $\psi_{\gamma}=1$ and exclude those with $\psi_{\gamma}=0$ in the sequence $\overrightarrow{\alpha}$ - notice in particular that $\psi_{\alpha}=\psi_{\beta}=1$ because we restricted to the set $U^{\prime}_{{\alpha\beta}}$. It satisfies the wanted cocycle condition because: at any point $x\in U^{\prime}_{{\alpha\beta\gamma}}$ for $\alpha<\beta<\gamma$ in $\mathcal{J}$ we have $\psi_{\alpha}=\psi_{\beta}=\psi_{\gamma}=1$ and so $\beta$ has to be included in the sequence $\overrightarrow{\alpha}=(\alpha=\alpha_{0}<\cdots<\alpha_{k}=\gamma)$ for $\psi_{\overrightarrow{\alpha}}$ to be non-zero. Indeed, we use that the subset $\mathcal{J}_{x}\subset\mathcal{J}$ defined by $\mathcal{J}_{x}=\{\delta\in\mathcal{J}\mid x\in U_{\delta}\}$ is totally ordered to conclude that if $\beta$ is not in $\overrightarrow{\alpha}$ then the factor $(1-\psi_{\beta})$ is part of the product defining the weight $\psi_{\overrightarrow{\alpha}}$, which is thus 0. Now we may use (\thechapter) and (9) repeatedly to see $\displaystyle\nabla^{{\alpha\gamma}}=\frac{\smashoperator[]{\sum_{\mathcal{J}_% {\alpha}^{\gamma}}^{}}\psi_{\overrightarrow{\alpha}}\nabla_{0}^{% \overrightarrow{\alpha}}}{\smashoperator[]{\sum_{\mathcal{J}_{\alpha}^{\gamma}% }^{}}\psi_{\overrightarrow{\alpha}}}=\frac{\left\lparen\smashoperator[]{\sum_{% \mathcal{J}_{\alpha}^{\beta}}^{}}\psi_{\overrightarrow{\alpha}}\nabla_{0}^{% \overrightarrow{\alpha}}\right\rparen{{\bullet}}\left\lparen\smashoperator[]{% \sum_{\mathcal{J}_{\beta}^{\gamma}}^{}}\psi_{\overrightarrow{\alpha}}\nabla_{0% }^{\overrightarrow{\alpha}}\right\rparen}{\left\lparen\smashoperator[]{\sum_{% \mathcal{J}_{\alpha}^{\beta}}^{}}\psi_{\overrightarrow{\alpha}}\right\rparen% \left\lparen\smashoperator[]{\sum_{\mathcal{J}_{\beta}^{\gamma}}^{}}\psi_{% \overrightarrow{\alpha}}\right\rparen}=\nabla^{{\alpha\beta}}{{\bullet}}\nabla% ^{{\beta\gamma}}.$ The choice is contractible because given two connective structures $\nabla$ and $\nabla^{\prime}$ equation (8) tells us that $t\nabla+(1-t)\nabla^{\prime}$ is a connective structure (this convex combination should be interpreted over every double intersection). $\square$ As constructed in the end of the previous section we can use the functor $\operatorname{Dger}$ to map charted oriented 2-vector bundles to charted gerbes. We will enrich this map such that it carries connective structures to connective structures. Construction Let $\mathcal{E}$ be a charted oriented 2-vector bundle. Taking the functor $\operatorname{Dger}$ from definition 3 on this charted bundle produces a 2-cocycle with coefficients in $\mathbb{C}^{*}$. Indeed, this is because the category $\mathcal{L}_{+}^{*}$ to which $\operatorname{Dger}$ maps is the strict monoidal category with one object, $\mathbb{C}^{*}$ as its automorphisms and monoidal product the same as composition. To get a connective structure we need a connection on each line bundle compatible with the isomorphisms. We construct this also using the functor $\operatorname{Dger}$: we simply define the parallel transport in $U_{{\alpha\beta}}\times\mathbb{C}$ along a path $f\colon[0,1]\to U_{{\alpha\beta}}$ by taking the functor $\operatorname{Dger}$ of the automorphism $P^{{\alpha\beta}}_{f}$ defined on $E^{{\alpha\beta}}$ by parallel transport in $\displaystyle U_{{\alpha\beta}}\times E^{{\alpha\beta}}$ along the path $f$ using the connections $\nabla^{{\alpha\beta}}$. Since the connection matrices are preserved using the isomorphisms $\phi^{{\alpha\beta\gamma}}$ we conclude that the parallel transport morphisms are preserved. So
Definition We say that a smooth charted 2-vector bundle is orientable if it is equivalent to a smooth charted 2-vector bundle which is the image of a smooth charted oriented 2-vector bundle under the strict monoidal functor $P_{\mathrm{Gl}_{n}(\mathcal{V})}$. $\blacklozenge$

[hovey, 1.3.12] A Quillen pair of model categories is a Quillen equivalence if for all cofibrant $X$ in $\mathcal{M}$ and fibrant $Y$ in $\mathcal{N}$, a map $f\colon FX\rightarrow Y$ is a weak equivalence in $\mathcal{D}$ if and only if the map $\varphi f\colon X\rightarrow GY$ is a weak equivalence in $\mathcal{M}$.
Definition 2.1. [hovey, 1.3.1] An adjoint pair of functors $F\colon\mathcal{M}\leftrightarrows\mathcal{N}\colon G$ between model categories is a Quillen pair if $F$ preserves cofibrations and $G$ preserves fibrations. The left adjoint $F$ is called a left Quillen functor, and the right adjoint $G$ is called the right Quillen functor.
Definition 3 Given a crossed module $\partial:C\rightarrow R$ and a morphism of $k$-algebras $\phi:S\rightarrow R,$ the pullback crossed module can be given by (i) a crossed $S$-module $\phi^{\ast}\left(C,R,\partial\right)=(\partial^{\ast}:\phi^{\ast}(C)% \rightarrow S)$ (ii) given $\left(f,\phi\right):\left(B,S,\mu\right)\longrightarrow\left(C,R,\partial\right)$ crossed module morphism, then there is a unique $\left(f^{\ast},id_{S}\right)$ crossed $S$-module morphism that commutes the following diagram: $\xymatrix@R=40pt@C=40pt{&(B,S,\mu)\ar@{.>}[dl]_{(f^{\ast},id_{S})}\ar[d]^{(f,% \phi)}\\ (\phi^{\ast}(C),S,\partial^{\ast})\ar[r]_{(\phi^{\prime},\phi)}&(C,R,\partial)}$ or more simply as $\xymatrix@R=20pt@C=20pt{B\ar[dd]_{\mu}\ar[rr]^{f}\ar@{.>}[dr]_{f^{\ast}}&&C\ar% [dd]^{\partial}\\ &\phi^{\ast}(C)\ar[ur]_{\phi^{\prime}}\ar[dl]^{\partial^{\ast}}&\\ S\ar[rr]_{\phi}&&R}$
Definition 5 For any crossed $S$-module $\partial:D\rightarrow S$ and $k$-algebra morphism $\phi:S\rightarrow R,$ the induced crossed module can be given by i) a crossed $R$-module $\phi_{\ast}\left(D,S,\partial\right)=\left(\partial_{\ast}:\phi_{\ast}(D)% \rightarrow R\right)$ ii) Given $\left(f,\phi\right):\left(D,S,\partial\right)\longrightarrow\left(B,R,\eta\right)$ crossed module morphism, then there is a unique $\left(f_{\ast},id_{R}\right)$ crossed $R$-module morphism such that commutes the following diagram $\xymatrix@R=40pt@C=40pt{(D,S,\partial)\ar[d]_{(f,\phi)}\ar[dr]^{(\phi^{\prime}% ,\phi)}\\ (B,R,\eta)\ar@{<.}[r]_{(f_{\ast},id_{R})}&(\phi_{\ast}(D),R,\partial_{\ast})}$ or more simply as $\xymatrix@R=20pt@C=20pt{D\ar[dd]_{\partial}\ar[rr]^{f}\ar[dr]_{\phi^{\prime}}&% &B\ar[dd]^{\eta}\\ &\phi_{\ast}(D)\ar@{.>}[ur]|-{f_{\ast}}\ar[dr]_{\partial_{\ast}}&\\ S\ar[rr]_{\phi}&&R}$
Definition 2.1. We are particularly interested in the category $\mathcal{M}^{\bf 2}$, sometimes known as the arrow category of $\mathcal{M}$. Its objects are arrows of $\mathcal{M}$, which we draw vertically, and its morphisms $(u,v)\colon f\Rightarrow g$ are commutative squares1We depict morphisms of $\mathcal{M}^{\bf 2}$ with a double arrow because $(u,v)$ is secretly a natural transformation between the functors $f,g\colon{\bf 2}\rightarrow\mathcal{M}$, though we do not often think of it as such.
Definition 0.3. Suppose $\mathcal{M}$ is a closed symmetric monoidal category. We say that $\mathcal{M}$ is left self-contained if, for every pair of monoids $E,E^{\prime}$ in $\mathcal{M}$ and every $\mathcal{M}$-functor $F\colon\,\operatorname{Mod-}E\xrightarrow{}\operatorname{Mod-}E^{\prime}$ that is a left adjoint, there is an $E\text{-}E^{\prime}$-bimodule $N$ and a natural isomorphism $T_{N}\cong F$. Similarly, $\mathcal{M}$ is right self-contained if, for every pair of monoids $E,E^{\prime}$ in $\mathcal{M}$ and every $\mathcal{M}$-functor $F\colon\,\operatorname{Mod-}E\xrightarrow{}(\operatorname{Mod-}E^{\prime})^{% \textup{op}}$ that is a left adjoint, there is an $E\otimes E^{\prime}$-module $N$ and a natural isomorphism $F\cong S_{N}$. We say that $\mathcal{M}$ is self-contained if it is both left and right self-contained.
Definition 7.1. Suppose $\mathcal{M}$ is a strongly cofibrantly generated, stable, monogenic, symmetric monoidal model category where the unit $S$ is cofibrant. Let $E$ be a monoid in $\mathcal{M}$, and $h\colon\,\operatorname{Ho}\operatorname{Mod-}E\xrightarrow{}\operatorname{Mod-}A$ be a homology (resp. cohomology) functor, where $A$ is an ordinary ring. We say that $h_{*}$ has a strict model if there is a monoid $E^{\prime}$ in $\mathcal{M}$ with $\operatorname{Ho}\mathcal{M}(S,E^{\prime})_{*}\cong A_{*}$ as rings, a left Quillen $\mathcal{M}$-functor (resp. a contravariant left Quillen $\mathcal{M}$-functor) $F\colon\,\operatorname{Mod-}E\xrightarrow{}\operatorname{Mod-}E^{\prime}$, and a natural isomorphism $\rho\colon\,h(X)\cong\operatorname{Ho}\operatorname{Mod-}E^{\prime}(E^{\prime}% ,FQX)\cong\operatorname{Ho}\mathcal{M}(S,FQX)$ of $A$-modules
Definition 3.1. (1) Suppose $\mathcal{M}$ is a monoidal category, and $f\colon\,A\xrightarrow{}B$ and $g\colon\,C\xrightarrow{}D$ are maps in $\mathcal{M}$. The pushout product of $f$ and $g$, written $f\Box g$, is the map $(A\otimes D)\amalg_{A\otimes C}(B\otimes C)\xrightarrow{}B\otimes D$ from the pushout of $A\otimes D$ and $B\otimes C$ over $A\otimes C$, to $B\otimes D$. (2) Now suppose $\mathcal{M}$ is a symmetric monoidal category equipped with a model structure. We say that $\mathcal{M}$ is a symmetric monoidal model category if the following conditions hold: (a) If $f$ and $g$ are cofibrations, then $f\Box g$ is a cofibration. (b) If $f$ is a cofibration and $g$ is a trivial cofibration, then $f\Box g$ is a trivial cofibration.
Definition 0.4. Suppose $\mathcal{M}$ is a closed symmetric monoidal model category. We say that $\mathcal{M}$ is homotopically left self-contained if, for every pair of monoids $E,E^{\prime}$ in $\mathcal{M}$ and every left Quillen $\mathcal{M}$-functor $F\colon\,\operatorname{Mod-}E\xrightarrow{}\operatorname{Mod-}E^{\prime}$, there is an $E\text{-}E^{\prime}$-bimodule $N$ and a natural isomorphism $LT_{N}\xrightarrow{}LF$ of functors on $\operatorname{Ho}\operatorname{Mod-}E$. Similarly, $F$ is homotopically right self-contained if, for every pair of monoids $E,E^{\prime}$ in $\mathcal{M}$ and every left Quillen $\mathcal{M}$-functor $F\colon\,\operatorname{Mod-}E\xrightarrow{}(\operatorname{Mod-}E^{\prime})^{% \textup{op}}$, there is an $E\otimes E^{\prime}$-module $N$ and a natural isomorphism $LF\xrightarrow{}LS_{N}$ of functors on $\operatorname{Ho}\operatorname{Mod-}E$. And $\mathcal{M}$ is homotopically self-contained if it is both left and right homotopically self-contained.
Definition 7.3. Suppose $R$ and $S$ are rings, and $h_{*}\colon\,\mathcal{D}(R)\xrightarrow{}\operatorname{Mod-}S$ is a homology (resp. cohomology) theory. We say that $h_{*}$ has a chain model if there is a DG-functor $F\colon\,\text{Ch}(R)\xrightarrow{}\text{Ch}(S)$ and a natural isomorphism $\rho\colon\,h_{*}(X)\cong H_{*}(FQX)$ of $S$-modules that is compatible with the suspension. To explain this, we assume $h_{*}$ is a homology theory and leave the evident modifications in the cohomology case to the reader. To say that $\rho$ is compatible with the suspension means that the isomorphism $h_{n}(X)\cong h_{n+1}(\Sigma X)$ corresponds to the composite $H_{n}(FQX)\cong H_{n+1}(S^{1}\otimes FQX)\xrightarrow{}H_{n+1}(F(S^{1}\otimes QX% ))\cong H_{n+1}(FQ\Sigma X),$ where the last isomorphism comes from the fact that $F$ preserves the homology isomorphism $Q\Sigma X=Q(S^{1}\otimes QX)\xrightarrow{}S^{1}\otimes QX$ between cofibrant objects. We remind the reader
Definition 3.2. Suppose $\mathcal{M}$ is a closed symmetric monoidal model category. We say that $\mathcal{M}$ is strongly cofibrantly generated if there are sets $I$ of cofibrations in $\mathcal{M}$ and $J$ of trivial cofibrations in $\mathcal{M}$ such that, for every monoid $E$ in $\mathcal{M}$, the sets $I\otimes E$ and $J\otimes E$ cofibrantly generate a model structure on $\operatorname{Mod-}E$ where the weak equivalences are maps of $E$-modules that are weak equivalences in $\mathcal{M}$.
Definition 2.3. Let $R$ be a ring and let $\mathcal{A}$ be a class of $R$-complexes. We say an $R$-complex $X$ is $\mathcal{A}$-complete if $\mathrm{Ext}_{R}^{*}(N,X)=0$ for any $\mathcal{A}$-null object $N$. An $R$-complex $C$ is an $\mathcal{A}$-completion of $X$ if $C$ is $\mathcal{A}$-complete and there is an $\mathcal{A}$-equivalence $X\to C$. It is easy to see that an $\mathcal{A}$-completion of a complex $X$ is unique up to an isomorphism in $\mathcal{D}_{R}$. As in [3], we denote an $\mathcal{A}$-completion of $X$ by $X^{\wedge}_{\mathcal{A}}$.
Definition 2.1. A hereditary torsion class $\mathcal{T}$ is a class of $R$-modules that is closed under submodules, quotient modules, coproducts and extensions. Closure under extensions means that if $0\to M_{1}\to M_{2}\to M_{3}\to 0$ is a short exact sequence with $M_{1}$ and $M_{3}$ in $\mathcal{T}$, then so is $M_{2}$. The modules in $\mathcal{T}$ will be called $\mathcal{T}$-torsion modules (or just torsion modules when the torsion theory is clear from the context). The class of torsion-free modules $\mathcal{F}$ is the class of all modules $F$ satisfying $\mathrm{Hom}_{R}(C,F)=0$ for every $C\in\mathcal{T}$. The pair $(\mathcal{T},\mathcal{F})$ is referred to as a hereditary torsion theory. To every hereditary torsion theory there is an associated radical $t$, where $t(M)$ is the maximal torsion submodule of $M$. Note that $M/t(M)$ is therefore torsion-free.
Definition 2.2. Let $(\mathcal{T},\mathcal{F})$ be a hereditary torsion theory and let $t$ be the associated radical. An $R$-module $M$ is called $\mathcal{F}$-closed if, for every left ideal $\mathfrak{a}\subset R$ such that $R/\mathfrak{a}\in\mathcal{T}$, the induced map $M=\mathrm{Hom}_{R}(R,M)\to\mathrm{Hom}_{R}(\mathfrak{a},M)$ is an isomorphism. The inclusion of the full subcategory of $\mathcal{F}$-closed modules has a left adjoint $M\mapsto M_{\mathcal{F}}$. The module $M_{\mathcal{F}}$ is called the module of quotients of $M$ (see [11, IX.1]). The unit of this adjunction has the following properties: the kernel of the map $M\to M_{\mathcal{F}}$ is $t(M)$, $M_{\mathcal{F}}$ is torsion-free and the cokernel of this map is a torsion module.
Definition 2.7. Given a hereditary torsion class of $R$-modules $\mathcal{T}$, we denote by $\mathcal{A}_{\mathcal{T}}$ the set of all cyclic $\mathcal{T}$-torsion modules.
Definition 2.2. Let $\mathcal{C}$ be an Abelian category and ($\mathcal{T}$,$\mathcal{F}$) a pair of full subcategories. ($\mathcal{T}$,$\mathcal{F}$) is said to be a torsion theory if: (1) Hom$(T,F)=0$, for all $T\in\mathcal{T}$ and $F\in\mathcal{F}$ (2) For all $M\in\mathcal{C}$ there is an exact sequence $0\longrightarrow\tau(M)\longrightarrow M\longrightarrow M/\tau{M}\longrightarrow 0$ where $\tau(M)\in\mathcal{T}$ and $M/\tau(M)\in\mathcal{F}$.
Definition 5.6. A perversity is a map $p:Y\longrightarrow\mathbb{Z}$ such that, given $\mathcal{T}_{\pi E_{1}}$, $\mathcal{T}_{\pi E_{2}}$ in $S$, if there is a nonzero homomorphism from $\pi E_{2}$ to $\pi E_{1}$ then $p(\mathcal{T}_{\pi E_{1}})-(GKdim(R/Ass(E_{2}))-GKdim(R/Ass(E_{1})))\leq p(% \mathcal{T}_{\pi E_{2}})\leq p(\mathcal{T}_{\pi E_{1}}).$
Definition 2.6. We say that a torsion theory in $Gr(R)$ is rigid if the class of torsion modules (equivalently, the class of torsion-free modules) is closed under shifts of the grading. The rigid torsion theory associated to an injective object $E$ in $Gr(R)$ is defined such that a module $M$ is torsion if $\overline{\textrm{Hom}}(M,E)=0$.
Definition 2.3. To an injective object $E$ in $Gr(R)$ we can associate a natural torsion theory in $Gr(R)$, for which a module $M$ is torsion if $\textrm{Hom}_{Gr(R)}(M,E)=0$. This torsion theory is said to be cogenerated by $E$ in $Gr(R)$.
Definition 5.1 Let $(X,A)$ and $(Y,B)$ be pairs consisting of a symplectic manifold and a lagrangian submanifold. A canonical relation $f$ to $X$ from $Y$ is liftlike with respect to $A$ and $B$ if there is a smooth map $\phi:A\to B$ such that $\displaystyle f(b)$ $\displaystyle=$ $\displaystyle\phi^{-1}(b),\quad\textrm{for all }b\in B,$ $\displaystyle Tf(v)$ $\displaystyle=$ $\displaystyle\big{(}T\phi\big{)}^{-1}(v),\quad\textrm{for all }v\in T_{b}B.$ where $Tf$ is the tangent bundle of $f$ considered as a submanifold of $TX\times TY$, hence a relation to $TX$ from $TY$.
Definition 5.3 A symplectic microfold is a microfold $[M,A]$ together with a germ of symplectic structure on $M$ for which $A$ is lagrangian. $[T^{*}A,A]$ with the canonical symplectic structure on $T^{*}A$ is the cotangent microbundle of $A$. A symplectic micromorphism to $[M,A]$ from $[N,B]$ is a lagrangian submicrofold of $[M,A]\times[\overline{N},B]$ having a representative which is liftlike with respect to $A$ and $B$. The associated map $\phi:A\to B$ is the core map of the micromorphism.
Definition 5.2 A manifold pair consists of a manifold $M$ and a closed submanifold $A\subseteq M$. Two manifold pairs $(M,A)$ and $(N,B)$ will be considered equivalent if $A=B$ and if there is a manifold pair $(U,A)$ such that $U$ is an open subset in both $M$ and $N$ simultaneously. A microfold is an equivalence class $[M,A]$ of manifold pairs $(M,A)$. The (well defined) submanifold $A$ is the core of $[M,A]$.
Definition 4.1 The Wehrheim-Woodward category $\mathbf{SYMP}$ is the category whose objects are symplectic manifolds and whose morphisms are generated by the canonical relations, subject to the relation that the composition of $f$ and $g$ in $\mathbf{SYMP}$ is equal to the composition in $\mathbf{REL}$ when $f{\pitchfork}g$.
Definition 2.1. A tensor category $\mathcal{C}$ is said to be braided if it is equipped with a class of natural isomorphisms $c_{V,W}:V\otimes W\rightarrow W\otimes V$ for objects $V,W\in\mathcal{C}$ satisfying the pair of hexagons which can be found in [K:QG] among many other places.
Definition 2.4. The center $Z(\mathcal{C})$ of a monoidal category $\mathcal{C}$ is the category having as objects pairs $(X,c)$ where $X\in\mathcal{C}$ and for every $Y\in\mathcal{C}$ $c_{Y}:Y\otimes X\rightarrow X\otimes Y$ is a family of natural isomorphisms satisfying the hexagon
Definition 1.2. [6] Let $\mathcal{S}=(\Pi,A,\xi),\ \mathcal{S}^{\prime}=(\Pi^{\prime},A^{\prime},\xi^{% \prime})$ be Gr-categories. A functor $F:\mathcal{S}\to\mathcal{S}^{\prime}$ is called a functor of the type $(\varphi,f)$ if $F(x)=\varphi(x)\ \ ,\ \ F(x,u)=(\varphi(x),f(u))$ and $\varphi:\Pi\to\Pi^{\prime}$, $f:A\to A^{\prime}$ is a pair of group homomorphisms satisfying $f(xa)=\varphi(x)f(a)$ for $x\in\Pi,a\in A.$
Definition 3.1. Let $\Gamma$ be a group and $\mathcal{C}$ be a Gr-category of the type $(\Pi,A)$. Factor sets $(\theta,F)$ and $(\mu,G)$ on $\Gamma$ with coefficients in $\mathcal{C}$ are cohomologous if there exists a family of isomorphisms of monoidal functors $u^{\sigma}:(F^{\sigma},\widetilde{F^{\sigma}},\widehat{F^{\sigma}})\stackrel{{% \scriptstyle\sim}}{{\longrightarrow}}(G^{\sigma},\widetilde{G^{\sigma}},% \widehat{G^{\sigma}})\quad(\sigma\in\Gamma)$ satisfying $u^{1}=id_{(\Pi,A)}$ $u^{\sigma\tau}.\theta^{\sigma\tau}=\mu^{\sigma,\tau}.u^{\sigma}G^{\tau}.F^{% \sigma}u^{\tau}\quad(\sigma,\tau\in\Gamma)$
Definition 1.1. Let $\Gamma$ be a group and let $(\mathcal{C},\otimes)$ be any monoidal category. We say that a factor set on $\Gamma$ with coefficients in $(\mathcal{C},\otimes)$ is a pair $(\theta,F)$ consisting of: a family of monoidal autoequivalences $F^{\sigma}=(F^{\sigma},\widetilde{F^{\sigma}},\widehat{F^{\sigma}}):\mathcal{C% }\longrightarrow\mathcal{C},(\sigma\in\Gamma)$ and a family of isomorphisms of monoidal functors $\theta^{\sigma,\tau}:F^{\sigma}F^{\tau}\stackrel{{\scriptstyle\sim}}{{% \longrightarrow}}F^{\sigma\tau},(\sigma,\tau\in\Gamma)$ satisfying the conditions i) $F^{1}=id_{\mathcal{C}}$ ii) $\theta^{1,\sigma}=id_{F^{\sigma}}=\theta^{\sigma,1}$ ($\sigma\in\Gamma$) iii) for all $\forall\sigma,\tau,\gamma\in\Gamma,$ the following diagrams are commutative $\begin{CD}F^{\sigma}F^{\tau}F^{\gamma}@>{\theta^{\sigma,\tau}F^{\gamma}}>{}>F^% {\sigma\tau}F^{\gamma}\\ @V{F^{\sigma}\theta^{\tau,\gamma}}V{}V@V{}V{\theta^{\sigma\tau,\gamma}}V\\ F^{\sigma}F^{\tau\gamma}@>{\theta^{\sigma,\tau\gamma}}>{}>F^{\sigma\tau\gamma}% \end{CD}$
Definition 1.4. [2] Let $\Gamma$ be a group, $\Pi$ be a $\Gamma-$group. A $\Gamma-$module $A$ is a equivariant module on $\Gamma-$group $\Pi$ if $A$ is a $\Pi-$module satisfying $\sigma(xa)=(\sigma x)(\sigma a),$ for all $\sigma\in\Gamma,x\in\Pi$ and $a\in A$.
Definition 2.15. An $A_{\infty}\text{-}$pre-category is a non-unital $A_{\infty}\text{-}$pre-category ${\mathcal{C}}$ which satisfies the following extension property: For any finite collection of transversal sequences $(S_{i})_{i\in I}$ in ${\mathcal{C}}$ and an object $X$ there exist objects $X_{-},X_{+}$ and quasi-isomorphisms $f_{-}:X_{-}\to X,$ $f_{+}:X\to X_{+}$ such that the sequences $(X_{-},S_{i},X_{+}),$ $i\in I,$ are transversal.
Definition 3.9. An $A_{\infty}\text{-}$structure on a graded pre-category ${\mathcal{C}}$ is a collection of maps $m_{n},$ $n\geq 3,$ $\deg(m_{n})=2-n$ for all transversal sequences, such that together with $m_{2}(a,b)=ab$ and $m_{1}=0$ they give a structure of $A_{\infty}\text{-}$pre-category on ${\mathcal{C}}.$ Two $A_{\infty}\text{-}$structures $m$ and $m^{\prime}$ on ${\mathcal{C}}$ are called strongly homotopic if there exists an $A_{\infty}\text{-}$morphism $F:({\mathcal{C}},m)\to({\mathcal{C}},m^{\prime})$ with $F(X)=X$ for $X\in Ob({\mathcal{C}}),$ and $f_{1}=\operatorname{id}.$ In this case $F$ is called a strong homotopy between $m$ and $m^{\prime}.$
Definition 4.1. A non-unital $A_{\infty}\text{-}$algebra $A$ is called nilpotent if it is equipped with finite decreasing filtration $A=F_{1}A\supset F_{2}A\supset\dots F_{n}A=0,$ such that $m_{k}(F_{r_{1}}A\otimes\dots\otimes F_{r_{k}}A)\subset F_{r_{1}+\dots+r_{k}}A.$
Definition 2.10. A strictly (resp. weakly) unital $A_{\infty}\text{-}$functor $F:{\mathcal{C}}\to{\mathcal{D}}$ between strictly (resp. weakly) unital $A_{\infty}\text{-}$categories is called a quasi-equivalence if the induced functor $H(F):H({\mathcal{C}})\to H({\mathcal{D}})$ is an equivalence of graded categories. Two $A_{\infty}$-categories with weak identity morphisms ${\mathcal{C}}$ and ${\mathcal{D}}$ are called quasi-equivalent if there exists a finite sequence of $A_{\infty}\text{-}$categories with weak identity morphisms ${\mathcal{C}}_{0}={\mathcal{C}},{\mathcal{C}}_{1},\dots,{\mathcal{C}}_{n}={% \mathcal{D}}$ such that for $0\leq i\leq n-1$ there exists a quasi-equivalence ${\mathcal{C}}_{i}\to{\mathcal{C}}_{i+1}$ or vice versa.
Definition 3.1. An $A_{\infty}\text{-}$(pre-)category ${\mathcal{C}}$ is called essentially small (resp. small) if the quasi-isomorphism classes in ${\mathcal{C}}$ form a set (resp. $Ob({\mathcal{C}})$ is a set).
