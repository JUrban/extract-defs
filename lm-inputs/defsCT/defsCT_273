Definition 4.7. Let $\mathcal{C}$ be an additive category, let $\mathcal{D}$ and $\mathcal{E}$ be exact structures on $\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathcal{A}$ a class of objects in $\mathcal{C}$. An object $X$ of $\mathcal{C}$ is called: (1) $\mathcal{D}$-$\mathcal{E}$-$\mathcal{A}$-divisible if every $\mathcal{D}$-inflation $X\rightarrowtail A$ with $A\in\mathcal{A}$ is an $\mathcal{E}$-inflation. (2) $\mathcal{D}$-$\mathcal{E}$-$\mathcal{A}$-flat if every $\mathcal{D}$-deflation $A\twoheadrightarrow X$ with $A\in\mathcal{A}$ is an $\mathcal{E}$-deflation.
Definition 2.12. Let $\mathcal{A}$ be a class of objects (always considered to be closed under isomorphisms) in a category $\mathcal{C}$. A morphism $f:A\to X$ in $\mathcal{C}$ with $A\in\mathcal{A}$ is called an $\mathcal{A}$-precover of $X$ if every morphism $f^{\prime}:A^{\prime}\to X$ in $\mathcal{C}$ with $A^{\prime}\in\mathcal{A}$ factors through $f$. An $\mathcal{A}$-precover $f:A\to X$ of $X$ is called an $\mathcal{A}$-cover if every endomorphism $g:A\to A$ with $fg=f$ is an automorphism. The class $\mathcal{A}$ is called (pre)covering if every object $X$ of $\mathcal{C}$ has an $\mathcal{A}$-(pre)cover. The concepts of $\mathcal{A}$-(pre)envelope and (pre)enveloping class are defined dually.
Definition 3.8. Let $\mathcal{C}$ be an additive category with an exact structure $\mathcal{D}$ . (1) A $\mathcal{D}$-projectively generated exact structure $\mathcal{E}$ on $\mathcal{C}$ is called a Xu exact structure if $Proj(\mathcal{E})={}^{\perp_{\mathcal{D}}}Div(\mathcal{D}\textrm{-}\mathcal{E})$. (2) A $\mathcal{D}$-injectively generated exact structure $\mathcal{E}$ on $\mathcal{C}$ is called a Xu exact structure if $Inj(\mathcal{E})=Flat(\mathcal{D}\textrm{-}\mathcal{E})^{\perp_{\mathcal{D}}}$.
Definition 2.10. Let $\mathcal{C}$ be an additive category with an exact structure $\mathcal{D}$. A $\mathcal{D}$-cotorsion pair $(\mathcal{A},\mathcal{B})$ in $\mathcal{C}$ is said to have: (1) enough $\mathcal{D}$-injectives if for every object $X$ of $\mathcal{C}$ there exists a $\mathcal{D}$-conflation $X\rightarrowtail B\twoheadrightarrow A$ for some objects $A\in\mathcal{A}$ and $B\in\mathcal{B}$. (2) enough $\mathcal{D}$-projectives if for every object $Z$ of $\mathcal{C}$ there exists a $\mathcal{D}$-conflation $B\rightarrowtail A\twoheadrightarrow Z$ for some objects $A\in\mathcal{A}$ and $B\in\mathcal{B}$. Also, $(\mathcal{A},\mathcal{B})$ is called $\mathcal{D}$-complete if $(\mathcal{A},\mathcal{B})$ has enough $\mathcal{D}$-injectives and enough $\mathcal{D}$-projectives.
Definition 2.13. Let $\mathcal{C}$ be an additive category with an exact structure $\mathcal{D}$ and $\mathcal{A}$ a class of objects in $\mathcal{C}$. An $\mathcal{A}$-precover relative to $\mathcal{D}$ of an object $C\in\mathcal{C}$ is a $\mathcal{D}$-deflation $f:X\twoheadrightarrow C$ with $X\in\mathcal{A}$ such that every morphism $f^{\prime}:X^{\prime}\to C$ in $\mathcal{C}$ with $X^{\prime}\in\mathcal{A}$ factors through $f$. An $\mathcal{A}$-precover relative to $\mathcal{D}$ of an object $C\in\mathcal{C}$ is called an $\mathcal{A}$-cover relative to $\mathcal{D}$ of $C$ if every endomorphism $g:X\to X$ with $fg=f$ is an automorphism. The class $\mathcal{A}$ is called a $\mathcal{D}$-precovering class ($\mathcal{D}$-covering class) if every object $C\in\mathcal{C}$ has an $\mathcal{A}$-precover ($\mathcal{A}$-cover) relative to $\mathcal{D}$. The concepts of $\mathcal{A}$-(pre)envelope relative to $\mathcal{D}$ and $\mathcal{D}$-(pre)enveloping class are defined dually. A $\mathcal{D}$-cotorsion pair $(\mathcal{A},\mathcal{B})$ in $\mathcal{C}$ is called $\mathcal{D}$-perfect if $\mathcal{A}$ is a $\mathcal{D}$-covering class and $\mathcal{B}$ is a $\mathcal{D}$-enveloping class.
Definition 2.4. Let $\mathcal{C}$ be an additive category with an exact structure $\mathcal{E}$. An object $X$ of $\mathcal{C}$ is called $\mathcal{E}$-injective if every $\mathcal{E}$-conflation starting with $X$ splits. Equivalently, $X$ is $\mathcal{E}$-injective if and only if ${\rm Ext}^{1}_{\mathcal{E}}(C,X)=0$ for every object $C$ of $\mathcal{C}$. The category $\mathcal{C}$ is said to have enough $\mathcal{E}$-injectives if for every object $X$ of $\mathcal{C}$ there exists an $\mathcal{E}$-conflation $X\rightarrowtail Y\twoheadrightarrow Z$ with $Y$ $\mathcal{E}$-injective. Dually, one defines $\mathcal{E}$-projective objects and categories having enough $\mathcal{E}$-projectives.
Definition 2.1. An exact category is an additive category $\mathcal{C}$ endowed with a distinguished class $\mathcal{E}$ of short exact sequences (i.e. kernel-cokernel pairs) satisfying the axioms $[E0]$, $[E1]$, $[E2]$ and $[E2^{\rm op}]$ below. Then $\mathcal{E}$ is called an exact structure on $\mathcal{C}$. The short exact sequences in $\mathcal{E}$ are called $\mathcal{E}$-conflations (or simply conflations), while kernels and cokernels appearing in such exact sequences are called inflations (denoted by $\rightarrowtail$) and deflations (denoted by $\twoheadrightarrow$) respectively. $[E0]$ The identity morphism $1_{0}:0\to 0$ is a deflation. $[E1]$ The composition of two deflations is again a deflation. $[E2]$ The pullback of a deflation along an arbitrary morphism exists and is again a deflation. $[E2^{\rm op}]$ The pushout of an inflation along an arbitrary morphism exists and is again an inflation.
Definition 2.9. [15, 17] Let $\mathcal{C}$ be an additive category with an exact structure $\mathcal{D}$. A $\mathcal{D}$-cotorsion pair in $\mathcal{C}$ is a pair of classes $(\mathcal{A},\mathcal{B})$ of objects in $\mathcal{C}$ such that $\mathcal{A}^{\perp_{\mathcal{D}}}=\mathcal{B}$ and ${}^{\perp_{\mathcal{D}}}\mathcal{B}=\mathcal{A}$. Let $\mathcal{A}$ be a class of objects of $\mathcal{C}$. The pair $({}^{\perp_{\mathcal{D}}}\mathcal{A},({}^{\perp_{\mathcal{D}}}\mathcal{A})^{% \perp_{\mathcal{D}}})$ is a $\mathcal{D}$-cotorsion pair in $\mathcal{C}$, called the $\mathcal{D}$-cotorsion pair generated by $\mathcal{A}$. The pair $({}^{\perp_{\mathcal{D}}}(\mathcal{A}^{\perp_{\mathcal{D}}}),\mathcal{A}^{% \perp_{\mathcal{D}}})$ is a $\mathcal{D}$-cotorsion pair in $\mathcal{C}$, called the $\mathcal{D}$-cotorsion pair cogenerated by $\mathcal{A}$.
Definition 3.5. Let $(A,\leq)$ and $(B,\leq)$ be posets. (1) A monotone Galois connection between $(A,\leq)$ and $(B,\leq)$ consists of a pair $(\alpha,\beta)$ of two order-preserving maps $\alpha:A\to B$ and $\beta:B\to A$ such that for all $a\in A$ and $b\in B$, we have $\alpha(a)\leq b$ if and only if $a\leq\beta(b)$. Equivalently, $(\alpha,\beta)$ is a monotone Galois connection if and only if for all $a\in A$, $a\leq\beta\alpha(a)$ and for all $b\in B$, $\alpha\beta(b)\leq b$. An element $a\in A$ (respectively $b\in B$) is called Galois with respect to $(\alpha,\beta)$ if $\beta\alpha(a)=a$ (respectively $\alpha\beta(b)=b$). (2) An antitone Galois connection between $(A,\leq)$ and $(B,\leq)$ is a monotone Galois connection between $(A,\leq)$ and $(B,\geq)$.
Definition 2.1 ([10], with a technical modification2We take all paths between two objects to be the nodes of $\mathcal{G}(G,G^{\prime})$; that is, $\mathcal{G}(G,G^{\prime})_{0}=(\mathcal{F}|\mathcal{G}|)(G,G^{\prime})$.) A computad $\mathcal{G}$ consists of a graph $|\mathcal{G}|$ (providing a set of objects $|\mathcal{G}|_{0}$ and a set of generating arrows $|\mathcal{G}|_{1}$), and for each pair of objects $G,G^{\prime}\in|\mathcal{G}|_{0}$ a graph $\mathcal{G}(G,G^{\prime})$ with a set nodes3$\mathcal{F}|\mathcal{G}|$ is the free category on a graph $|\mathcal{G}|$ $\mathcal{G}(G,G^{\prime})_{0}=(\mathcal{F}|\mathcal{G}|)(G,G^{\prime})$ and a set of edges denoted $\mathcal{G}(G,G^{\prime})_{1}$ (providing generating 2-cells).
Definition 1.5. A ballean $(X,\mathcal{E}_{X})$ is defined to have bounded growth if there exists a subset $G\subset X\times X$ such that • for every bounded set $B\subset X$ the set $G[B]=\{y\in X:\exists x\in B\;(x,y)\in G\}$ is bounded in $X$; • for every entourage $E\in\mathcal{E}_{X}$ there exists a bounded set $B\subset X$ such that $E[x]\subset G[x]$ for all $x\in X\setminus B$. The function $G$ will be refered to as a growth entourage of the ballean $X$.
Definition 1.9. A ballean $(X,\mathcal{E}_{X})$ is called discrete if $X$ is unbounded and for any entourage $E\in\mathcal{E}_{X}$ there exists a bounded set $B_{E}\subset X$ such that $E[x]=\{x\}$ for all $x\in X\setminus B_{E}$.
Definition 11.3. We say that a subgroup $G\subset S_{X}$ is infinitely mixing if for any infinite sets $I,J\subset X$ there exists a permutation $g\in G$ such that the intersection $g(I)\cap J$ is infinite.
Definition 4.2. Let $\mathcal{A}$ be a locally finitely presented Grothendieck category. An object $M$ in $\mathcal{A}$ is called Ding projective if there exists an exact complex of projective objects in $\mathcal{A}$ which has $M$ as a syzygy and remains exact after applying functors of the form $\operatorname{Hom}_{\mathcal{A}}(-,F)$, for $F$ a flat object in $\mathcal{A}$. We denote the class of Ding projective objects in $\mathcal{A}$ by $\operatorname{DProj}(\mathcal{A})$.
Definition 3.4. [16, Dfn. 3.4] Let $\mathcal{M}$ be an abelian category with enough projectives. A complete cotorsion pair $(\mathcal{C},\mathcal{W})$ in $\mathcal{M}$ is called projective if $\mathcal{C}\cap\mathcal{W}=\operatorname{Proj}\mathcal{M}$ and $\mathcal{W}$ is thick. In this case $(\mathcal{C},\mathcal{W},\mathcal{M})$ is a Hovey triple on $\mathcal{M}$. Dually, if $\mathcal{M}$ has enough injectives, a complete cotorsion pair $(\mathcal{W},\mathcal{F})$ in $\mathcal{M}$ is called injective if $\mathcal{W}\cap\mathcal{F}=\operatorname{Inj}\mathcal{M}$ and $\mathcal{W}$ is thick. In this case $(\mathcal{M},\mathcal{W},\mathcal{F})$ is a Hovey triple on $\mathcal{M}$. In this paper, we call an abelian model structure projective (resp. injective) if its associated Hovey triple is induced by a projective (resp. injective) cotorsion pair.
Definition 4.3. Let $\mathcal{A}$ be a locally finitely presented Grothendieck category. An object $M$ in $\mathcal{A}$ is called Ding injective if there exists an exact complex of injectives in $\mathcal{A}$ which has $M$ as a syzygy and remains exact after applying functors of the form $\operatorname{Hom}_{\mathcal{A}}(F,-)$, for $F$ an fp-injective object in $\mathcal{A}$. We denote the class of Ding injective objects in $\mathcal{A}$ by $\operatorname{DInj}(\mathcal{A})$.
Definition 5.1 (Consonances). Let $(\kappa/\delta)$ be a dichotomy. A consonance is a morphism $\xi$ (of $\mathcal{E}$) from the terminal object $\mathbf{1}$ of $\mathcal{E}$ to $K$, that is, a point of $K$. More generally, a generalized consonance can be defined as a morphism $\xi$ of $\mathcal{E}$ with codomain $K$.
Definition 9.1. A positive integer $p$ is called maximal if $\pi(p)=2^{bit(p-1)}$.
Definition 2.2. Let $\mathcal{G}$ be a Grothendieck category. An object $M$ of $\mathcal{G}$ is called: (1) flat if every epimorphism $A\to M$ in $\mathcal{G}$ is pure. (2) cotorsion if ${\rm Ext}^{1}_{\mathcal{G}}(A,M)=0$ for every flat object $A$ of $\mathcal{G}$. (3) weakly absolutely pure if every monomorphism $M\to A$ in $\mathcal{G}$ with $A$ flat is pure.
Definition 2.1. Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a finitely accessible additive category. An object $X$ of $\mathcal{C}$ is called: (1) pure-injective if it is injective with respect to every pure monomorphism in $\mathcal{C}$. (2) absolutely pure if every monomorphism $X\to Y$ in $\mathcal{C}$ is pure.
Definition 3.16. Let $\mathcal{N}$ be a class of right $R$-modules. A ring $R$ is called right $\mathcal{N}$-coherent if every $N\in\mathcal{N}$ is $2$-presented, that is, there is an exact sequence $F_{2}\to F_{1}\to F_{0}\to N\to 0$ of right $R$-modules with $F_{0},F_{1},F_{2}$ finitely generated free.
Definition 1.1. A sheaf $F$ on a topological space (or locale) $X$ is flabby if and only if for all opens $U$ and all sections $s\in F(U)$, there is an open covering $X=\bigcup_{i}U_{i}$ such that, for all $i$, the section $s$ can be extended to a section on $U\cup U_{i}$.
Definition 3.1. An object $X$ of an elementary topos $\mathcal{E}$ is flabby if and only if the statement “$X$ is a flabby set” holds in the stack semantics of $\mathcal{E}$.
Definition 2.5. (1) A set $I$ is injective if and only if, for any injection $i:A\to B$, any map $f:A\to I$ can be extended to a map $B\to I$. (2) An $R$-module $I$ is injective if and only if, for any linear injection $i:A\to B$ between $R$-modules, any linear map $f:A\to I$ can be extended to a linear map $B\to I$, as in the diagram below. $\xymatrix{A\ar@{{}^{(}->}[r]\ar[d]&B\ar@{-->}@/^{/}[ld]\\ I}$
Definition 3.6. An object $I$ of an elementary topos $\mathcal{E}$ is externally injective if and only if for any monomorphism $A\to B$ in $\mathcal{E}$, the canonical map $\operatorname{Hom}_{\mathcal{E}}(B,I)\to\operatorname{Hom}_{\mathcal{E}}(A,I)$ is surjective. It is internally injective if and only if for any monomorphism $A\to B$ in $\mathcal{E}$, the canonical morphism $[B,I]\to[A,I]$ between Hom objects is an epimorphism in $\mathcal{E}$.
Definition 2.1. A set $X$ is flabby if and only if any subterminal subset of $X$ is a subsingleton, that is, if and only if for any subset $K\subseteq X$ such that $\forall x,y\in K\mathpunct{.}\,x=y$, there exists an element $x\in X$ such that $K\subseteq\{x\}$.
Definition 2.1. Let $V$ be a finite dimensional rational vector space and let $k\in\mathbb{Z}$. A pure Hodge structure of weight $k$ on $V$ consists of a finite decreasing filtration $F^{\bullet}$ of $V_{\mathbb{C}}=V\otimes_{\mathbb{Q}}\mathbb{C}$ $V_{\mathbb{C}}\supseteq\ldots\supseteq F^{p-1}\,V\supseteq F^{p}\,V\supseteq F% ^{p+1}\,V\supseteq\ldots\supseteq\left\{0\right\}$ such that $F^{p}\,V\oplus\,\overline{F^{k-p+1}\,V}=V_{\mathbb{C}}$ where conjugation is taken with respect to the induced real structure.
Definition 2.5. Given a weight $k$ pure Hodge structure $V$, a polarization of $V$ is a bilinear form $Q:V\otimes V\to\mathbb{Q}(-k)$, preserving the Hodge structures, such that • $Q(u,v)=(-1)^{k}Q(v,u)$ for all $u,v\in V$. • The bilinear form $(2\pi i)^{k}Q(Cu,\overline{v})$ is an hermitian product on $V_{\mathbb{C}}$, where $C:V_{\mathbb{C}}\to V_{\mathbb{C}}$ is the Weil operator given by $Cv=i^{p-q}v$, for $v\in V^{p,q}$. A mixed Hodge structure is said to be graded polarizable if each of the pure Hodge structures on $Gr_{k}^{W}V$ are polarizable.
Definition 2.4. Let $V$ be a finite dimensional rational vector space. A (rational) mixed Hodge structure on $V$ consist of a pair of filtrations: • An increasing finite filtration $W_{\bullet}$ of $V$, called the weight filtration. • A decreasing finite filtration $F^{\bullet}$ of $V_{\mathbb{C}}$, called the Hodge filtration. Such that, for any $k\in\mathbb{Z}$, the induced filtration of $F^{\bullet}$ on the graded complex $(Gr^{W}_{k}\,V)_{\mathbb{C}}=\left(\frac{W_{k}\,V}{W_{k-1}\,V}\right)_{\mathbb% {C}}$ gives a pure Hodge structure of weight $k$. Given two mixed Hodge structures $(V,F,W)$ and $(V^{\prime},F^{\prime},W^{\prime})$, a morphism of mixed Hodge structures is a linear map $f:V\to V^{\prime}$ preserving both filtrations.

Let $\{C_{i}\}_{i=1}^{t}$ be a collection of smooth rational curves in a smooth quasi-projective CY 3-fold $Y$ with fixed CY-structure $\eta:{\mathcal{O}}_{Y}\stackrel{{{}_{\sim}}}{{\rightarrow}}\omega_{Y}$, such that $\{{\mathcal{O}}_{C_{i}}\}$ form a semi-simple collection. Denote by ${\mathcal{C}}(Y,\{C_{i}\}_{i=1}^{t},\eta)$ for the (topological) cluster category associated to the derived deformation algebra of $\bigoplus_{i=1}^{t}{\mathcal{O}}_{C_{i}}$. We call ${\mathcal{C}}(Y,\{C_{i}\}_{i=1}^{t},\eta)$ the cluster category associated to the triple $(Y,\eta,\{C_{i}\}_{i=1}^{t})$.
Definition 4.11. Let $k$ be a field and $l$ be a finite dimensional commutative separable $k$-algebra, and let ${\Gamma}$ be a pseudo-compact dg $l$-algebra concentrated in nonpositive degrees. Assume that ${\Gamma}$ is exact 3CY. Then ${\Gamma}$ is called quasi-homogeneous if the canonical class $[w]$ is (right equivalent to) zero.
Definition 3.3. The dg algebra ${\Gamma}$ is said to satisfy the relative dCY property if for $L\in\mathrm{D}_{fd}({\Gamma})$ and $M\in{\mathrm{per}}({\Gamma})$, we have $D{\mathbf{R}\mathrm{Hom}}_{\mathrm{D}({\Gamma})}(L,M)\simeq{\mathbf{R}\mathrm{% Hom}}_{\mathrm{D}({\Gamma})}(M,\Sigma^{d}L).$
Definition 5.1. Let $A$ be an associative $k$-algebra. Then the singular Hochschild cochain complex of $A$, denoted by $C_{sg}^{*}(A,A)$, is defined as the colimit of the inductive system in the category of cochain complexes of $k$-modules, $\xymatrix{0\ar[r]&C^{*}(A,A)\ar[r]^{-}{\theta_{0}}&C^{*}(A,\Sigma\Omega^{1}_{A% })\ar[r]^{-}{\theta_{1}}&\ldots\ar[r]&C^{*}(A,\Sigma^{n}\Omega_{A}^{n})\ar[r]^% {-}{\theta_{n}}&\ldots.}$ Namely, $C^{*}_{sg}(A,A):=\mbox{colim}_{n}C^{*}(A,\Sigma^{n}\Omega^{n}_{A})$. Its cohomology groups are denoted by ${\mathrm{HH}}^{*}_{sg}(A,A)$.
Definition 3.9. Let $Y$ be a $d$-dimensional smooth quasi-projective $k$-variety. We call $Y$ a $d$-dimensional Calabi–Yau variety if there is an isomorphism $\omega_{Y}:=\Omega^{d}_{Y}\cong{\mathcal{O}}_{Y}$, i.e. there exists a nowhere vanishing $d$-form. We call a nowhere vanishing section $\eta:{\mathcal{O}}_{Y}\to\omega_{Y}$ a dCY structure on $Y$. We call the dCY structure exact if the the $d$-form $\eta$ is exact, i.e. there exists a $(d-1)$-form $\xi\in\Omega^{d-1}_{Y}$ such that ${\mathrm{d}}\xi=\eta$. If ${\widehat{Y}}$ is a smooth formal scheme, we may define dCY structure in a similar way by using formal differential forms $\Omega_{\widehat{Y}}^{d}$. A quasi-projective Gorenstein $d$-fold $Y$ is called Gorenstein CY if $\omega_{Y}\cong{\mathcal{O}}_{Y}$.
Definition 3.1. A right Serre functor for ${\mathcal{T}}$ is a triangle functor $S\colon{\mathcal{T}}\to{\mathcal{T}}$ such that there are bifunctorial isomorphisms ${\mathcal{T}}(Y,SX)\to D{\mathcal{T}}(X,Y)$ for all $X,Y\in{\mathcal{T}}$. It is a Serre functor if it is an autoequivalence.
Definition 4.1. (Ginzburg) Let $Q$ be a finite quiver and $w$ a potential on $Q$. Let $\overline{Q}$ be the graded quiver with the same vertices as $Q$ and whose arrows are $\bullet$ the arrows of $Q$ (of degree 0); $\bullet$ an arrow $a^{*}:j\to i$ of degree $-1$ for each arrow $a:i\to j$ of $Q$; $\bullet$ a loop $t_{i}:i\to i$ of degree $-2$ for each vertex $i$ of $Q$. The (complete) Ginzburg (dg)-algebra ${\mathfrak{D}}(Q,w)$ is the dg $k$-algebra whose underlying graded algebra is the completion (in the category of graded vector spaces) of the graded path algebra $k\overline{Q}$ with respect to the two-sided ideal generated by the arrows of $\overline{Q}$. Its differential is the unique linear endomorphism homogeneous of degree 1 satisfying the Leibniz rule, and which takes the following values on the arrows of $\overline{Q}$: $\bullet$ $da=0$ for $a\in Q_{1}$; $\bullet$ $d(a^{*})=D_{a}w$ for $a\in Q_{1}$; $\bullet$ $d(t_{i})=e_{i}(\sum_{a\in Q_{1}}[a,a^{*}])e_{i}$ for $i\in Q_{0}$ where $e_{i}$ is the idempotent associated to $i$. Denote by $l$ the product $\prod_{i\in Q_{0}}ke_{i}$. Then $\widehat{kQ}$ is isomorphic to the complete tensor algebra $\widehat{T_{l}V}$ with $V$ being the vector space spanned by arrows of $Q$.
Definition 6.2. Let $S=k[u^{-1}]$ be the commutative dg algebra with ${\mathrm{deg}}(u)=2,{\mathrm{deg}}(u^{-1})=-2$ and zero differential. We call a dg $k$-algebra $A$ ${k[u^{-1}]}$-enhanced if $A$ is isomorphic to a dg ${k[u^{-1}]}$-algebra in the homotopy category of dg $k$-algebras.

Definition 4.15. Fix $\widehat{F}$ to be the complete free associative algebra ${\mathbb{C}}{\langle\langle}x_{1},\ldots,x_{n}{\rangle\rangle}$. Let $(r_{1},\ldots,r_{n})$ be a tuple of rational numbers. A potential $w\in\widehat{F}_{{\mathrm{cyc}}}:=\widehat{F}/[\widehat{F},\widehat{F}]^{c}$ is said to be weighted-homogeneous of type $(r_{1},\ldots,r_{n})$ if it has a representative which is a linear combination of monomials $x_{i_{1}}x_{i_{2}}\cdots x_{i_{p}}$ such that $r_{i_{1}}+r_{i_{2}}+\ldots r_{i_{p}}=1$.
Definition 2.10. Let $Y$ be a normal variety of dimension 3. A flopping contraction is a proper birational morphism $f:Y\to X$ to a normal variety $Y$ such that $f$ is an isomorphism in codimension one, and $K_{Y}$ is $f$-trivial. If $Y$ is smooth, then we call $f$ a smooth flopping contraction.
Definition 3.25. Let $R$ be a complete local equicodimensional Gorenstein normal domain of dimension $3$ over an algebraically closed field $k$ of characteristic zero, and let $A$ be the NCCR associate to the collection of indecomposables $R,N_{1},\ldots,N_{t}$. Fix a 3CY structure $\eta\in{\mathrm{HH}}_{3}(A,A)$. Denote by ${\mathcal{C}}(R,\{N_{i}\}_{i=1}^{t},\eta)$ the cluster category associated to the dg algebra ${\Gamma}$ constructed in Theorem 2.8, and call it the cluster category associated to the triple $(R,\{N_{i}\}_{i=1}^{t},\eta)$.
Definition 2.7. Let $(R,{\mathfrak{m}})$ be a complete commutative Noetherian local Gorenstein $k$-algebra of Krull dimension $n$ with isolated singularity and with residue field $k$. Denote the category of maximal Cohen–Macaulay (MCM) modules by ${\mathrm{CM}}_{R}$ and its stable category by $\underline{{\mathrm{CM}}}_{R}$. Let $N_{0}=R,N_{1},N_{2},\ldots,N_{t}$ be pairwise non-isomorphic indecomposables in ${\mathrm{CM}}_{R}$ and $A:={\mathrm{End}}_{R}(\bigoplus_{i=0}^{t}N_{i})$. We call $A$ a noncommutative resolution (NCR) of $R$ if it has finite global dimension. A NCR is called a noncommutative crepant resolution (NCCR) if $A$ further satisfies that $(a)$ $A\in{\mathrm{CM}}_{R}$; $(b)$ ${\rm{gldim}}(A)=n$.
Definition 2.1. [14, Definition 10.1] Fix an artinian augmented dg $l$-algebra ${\mathcal{R}}$. An object of the groupoid ${\mathrm{Def}}_{\mathcal{R}}(E)$ is a pair $(S,\sigma)$, where $S$ is an object of $\mathrm{D}({\mathcal{A}}_{\mathcal{R}})$ and $\sigma:\varepsilon^{*}(S)\to E$ is an isomorphism in $\mathrm{D}(l^{op}{\otimes}{\mathcal{A}})$. A morphism $f:(S,\sigma)\to(T,\tau)$ between two ${\mathcal{R}}$-deformations of $E$ is an isomorphism $f:S\to T$ in $\mathrm{D}({\mathcal{A}}_{\mathcal{R}})$ such that $\tau_{i}\circ\varepsilon^{*}(f)=\sigma.$ This defines the groupoid ${\mathrm{Def}}_{\mathcal{R}}(E)$. A homomorphism of artinian dg $l$-algebras $\phi:{\mathcal{R}}\to{\mathcal{Q}}$ induces the functor $\phi^{*}:{\mathrm{Def}}_{\mathcal{R}}(E)\to{\mathrm{Def}}_{\mathcal{Q}}(E)$ given by ${\mathcal{Q}}{\overset{\mathbb{L}}{{\otimes}}}_{\mathcal{R}}?$. Thus we obtain a pseudo-functor ${\mathrm{Def}}(E):{\mathbf{dgArt}}_{l}\to{\bf{Gpd}}.$ We call ${\mathrm{Def}}(E)$ the pseudo-functor of derived deformations of $E$. We denote by ${\mathrm{Def}}_{-}(E)$ the restrictions of the pseudo-functor ${\mathrm{Def}}(E)$ to the subcategory ${\mathbf{dgArt}}_{l}^{-}$.
Definition 6.1. Let $S$ be a commutative dg algebra. Denote by ${\mathscr{C}}(S)$ the category of complexes of $S$-modules with the monoidal structure given by the tensor product over $S$. A dg $S$-algebra is an algebra in ${\mathscr{C}}(S)$, i.e. a dg $S$-module with an $S$-bilinear multiplication and a unit.
Definition 4.3. Let $Q$ be a finite quiver and $w$ a potential on $Q$. The Jacobi algebra ${\Lambda}(Q,w)$ is the zeroth homology of ${\mathfrak{D}}(Q,w)$, which is the quotient algebra $\widehat{kQ}/((D_{a}w,a\in Q_{1}))^{c}$ where $((D_{a}w,a\in Q_{1}))^{c}$ is the closed two-sided ideal generated by $D_{a}w$. A Ginzburg algebra ${\mathfrak{D}}(Q,w)$ is called Jacobi-finite if $\dim_{k}{\Lambda}(Q,w)<\infty$.
Definition 3.2. The dg algebra ${\Gamma}$ is called bimodule dCY if it is homologically smooth and there is an isomorphism in $\mathrm{D}({\Gamma}^{e})$ $\eta:\Theta_{\Gamma}\stackrel{{{}_{\sim}}}{{\rightarrow}}\Sigma^{-d}{\Gamma}.$ A class $\eta\in{\mathrm{HH}}_{d}({\Gamma})$ is called a dCY structure if the corresponding morphism $\eta:\Theta_{\Gamma}\to\Sigma^{-d}{\Gamma}$ is an isomorphism in $\mathrm{D}({\Gamma}^{e})$. A dCY structure $\eta$ is called exact if there exists a class $\xi\in{\mathrm{HC}}_{d-1}({\Gamma})$ such that $B\xi=\eta$, where $B$ is the Connes morphism. We call a bimodule dCY algebra ${\Gamma}$ an exact dCY algebra if the dCY structure is exact in addition.
Definition 1.6. Let $n$ be a non negative integer. Let $\underline{i}=i_{0},\ldots,i_{n}$ be a sequence in $Q_{0}$. Let $V\in\mathrm{mod}(\mathbbm{k}G_{i_{n}})$. (1) For all sequences $\underline{y}=y_{1},\ldots,y_{n}$, where $y_{t}\in[G/G_{i_{t}}]$ for all $t\in\{1,\ldots,n\}$, let $M_{\underline{y}}(\underline{i};V)$ be the following vector space, $M_{\underline{y}}(\underline{i};V)=\,_{i_{0}}M_{y_{1}\cdot i_{1}}\otimes_{% \mathbbm{k}}\,{}_{y_{1}\cdot i_{1}}M_{y_{1}y_{2}\cdot i_{2}}\otimes_{\mathbbm{% k}}\cdots\otimes_{\mathbbm{k}}\,{}_{y_{1}\cdots y_{n-1}\cdot i_{n-1}}M_{y_{1}% \cdots y_{n}\cdot i_{n}}\otimes_{\mathbbm{k}}y_{1}\cdots y_{n}V\,,$ where $y_{1}\cdots y_{n}V$ stands for the vector subspace $y_{1}\cdots y_{n}\otimes_{\mathbbm{k}}V$ of $\mathbbm{k}G\otimes_{\mathbbm{k}}V$. (2) Define the $\mathbbm{k}G_{i_{0}}$-module $M(\underline{i};V)$ as follows. Its underlying vector space is $\bigoplus_{\underline{y}}M_{\underline{y}}(\underline{i};V)\,,$ where $\underline{y}$ runs through all possible sequences such as in (1). For all $g\in G_{i_{0}}$, the action of $g$ is written exponentially and defined as follows. For all $\underline{y}$, there exist a unique sequence $\underline{y}^{\prime}=y_{1}^{\prime},\ldots,y_{n}^{\prime}$, where $y_{t}^{\prime}\in[G/G_{i_{t}}]$ for all $t\in\{1,\ldots,n\}$, and a unique $h\in G_{i_{n}}$, such that • $gy_{1}\cdots y_{t}G_{i_{t}}=y_{1}^{\prime}\cdots y_{t}^{\prime}G_{i_{t}}$ for all $t\in\{1,\ldots,n\}$, • and $gy_{1}\cdots y_{n}=y_{1}^{\prime}\cdots y_{n}^{\prime}h$; then, the action of $g$ transforms $M_{\underline{y}}(\underline{i};V)$ into $M_{\underline{y}^{\prime}}(\underline{i};V)$ and, for all $m_{1}\otimes\cdots\otimes m_{n}\otimes y_{1}\cdots y_{n}v\in M_{\underline{y}}% (\underline{i};V)$, ${}^{g}\left(m_{1}\otimes\cdots\otimes m_{n}\otimes y_{1}\cdots y_{n}v\right)=% \,^{g}m_{1}\otimes\cdots\otimes\,^{g}m_{n}\otimes y_{1}^{\prime}\cdots y_{n}^{% \prime}\,{}^{h}v\,.$
