Definition 4.3 An $n$-tree is called reduced if it is pruned, nondegenerate and is not equal to $U_{n}.$ A planar tree decorated by $n$-ordinals is called reduced if all the decorations are reduced.
Definition 9.2 A coloured morphism between coloured trees $\sigma:T\rightarrow S$ is a morphism of underlying trees such that $\xi_{S}(\sigma(a))=1$ for $a\in\xi^{-1}(1).$
Definition 2.2 (Kontsevich-Soibelman [14]) Let $I$ be a set. Suppose we have an $n$-tuple of partial orders $\Xi=(<_{0},\ldots,<_{n-1})$ on $I.$ We call them complementary orders provided any two elements $i,j\in I$ can be compared with respect to exactly one order $<_{0},\ldots,<_{n-1}.$
Definition 7.1 The Getzler-Jones $n$-operad $\mbox{$\bf GJ$}^{n}$ is the image of $\Phi.$ This is a reduced $(n-1)$-terminal $n$-operad.
Definition 3.2 A pruned ($(n-1)$-terminal) $n$-collection in $V$ is a family of objects $A_{T}\in V$, where $T$ runs over the set of pruned $n$-trees. They form a category $PColl_{n}(V)$ with respect to termwise morphisms of collections.
Definition 2.6 Suppose we are given two $n$-tuples of complementary orders $\Xi_{1}$ and $\Xi_{2}$ on the same set $X.$ We will say that $\Xi_{1}$ dominates $\Xi_{2}$ (notation $\Xi_{2}\triangleleft\Xi_{1}$) if $i<_{p}j$ in $\Xi_{1}$ implies $i<_{r}j$ for some $r\geq p$ or $j<_{r}i$ for $r>p$ in $\Xi_{2}.$
Definition 4.1 A pruned $(n-1)$-terminal $n$-operad $A$ is called reduced if $A_{z^{n}U_{0}}=A_{U_{n}}=I$ and its unit is given by the identity. A morphism between two reduced $n$-operads is an $n$-operadic morphism which induces identity morphisms in arity $z^{n}U_{0}$ and $U_{n}.$
Definition 2.5 Let $X$ and $Y$ be two $n$-ordered sets. An order preserving map (or a map of $n$-ordered sets) from $X$ to $Y$ is a map $f:X\rightarrow Y$ such that $i<_{p}j$ in $X$ implies that $f(i)\leq_{r}f(j)$ for some $r\geq p$ or $f(j)<_{r}f(i)$ for $r>p.$
Definition 2.8 A labelled $n$-planar tree is a labelled tree such that for every internal vertex $v$ the set of incoming edges is a totally $n$-ordered set.
Definition 6.1 A generalised $n$-tree $X$ is a chain of partially ordered sets and functions $R^{n}\stackrel{{\scriptstyle\rho_{n-1}}}{{\longrightarrow}}R^{n-1}\stackrel{{% \scriptstyle\rho_{n-2}}}{{\longrightarrow}}\ldots\stackrel{{\scriptstyle\rho_{% 1}}}{{\longrightarrow}}R^{1}\stackrel{{\scriptstyle\rho_{0}}}{{\longrightarrow% }}R^{0}=1$ such that the induced order on $\rho_{i}^{-1}(a)$ is linear for all $0\leq i\leq n-1$ and $a\in R^{i}.$ A topological $n$-tree is an $n$-tree for which all $R^{i}$ are endowed with a topology and all $\rho_{i}$ are continuous functions.
Definition 2.1 A partial order on a set $X$ is a transitive, antireflective relation on $X.$ It is called linear if any two elements are comparable.
Definition 4.4 An unbased reduced $n$-operad in a symmetric monoidal category $V$ consists of a collection of objects $A_{T}\in V$, one for every reduced $n$-tree $T,$ and $A_{U_{n}}=I,$ together with a multiplication $\mu_{\sigma}:A_{S}\otimes A_{T_{1}^{(p)}}\otimes\ldots\otimes A_{T_{k}^{(p)}}% \rightarrow A_{T}$ for every surjection of $n$-trees $\sigma:T\rightarrow S,$ satisfying the usual associativity axiom and the unitarity axiom with respect to the identity morphism $I\rightarrow A_{U_{n}}.$
Definition 2.7 Let $f:T\rightarrow S$ be an order preserving map of $n$-ordinals. For an element $i\in S,$ the preimage $f^{-1}(i)$ with its natural structure of an $n$-ordinal induced from $T$ will be called the fiber of $f$ over $i$.
Definition 2.4 We will call an $n$-ordered set $X$ totally $n$-ordered if it satisfies the conditions of lemma 2.2. If $X=\{1,\ldots,k\}$ is totally $n$-ordered and the induced linear order makes it equal to the ordinal $[k]$ then we call $X$ an $n$-ordinal. This includes the case of a terminal ordinal (one element set and empty $n$ complementary orders) and of an initial ordinal (empty set).
Definition 2.3 A set with a given $n$-tuple of complementary orders on it will be called an $n$-ordered set.
Definition 9.3 A reduced SC type $n$-operad in a symmetric monoidal category $V$ is a collection $A_{T}\in V$ where $T$ runs over all coloured pruned $n$-trees such that $A_{U^{1}_{n}}=A_{U^{2}_{n}}=I$ and $A_{z^{n}U_{0}}=I,$ where $U^{1}_{n}$ is a linear tree with its unique tip coloured by $1$ and $U^{2}_{n}$ is a linear tree with its tip coloured by $2.$ This collection is equipped with a morphism $m_{\sigma}:A_{S}\otimes A_{T_{1}^{(p)}}\otimes\ldots\otimes A_{T_{k}^{(p)}}% \rightarrow A_{T}$ for every coloured morphism of trees $\sigma:T\rightarrow S$ between coloured pruned $n$-trees. They must satisfy the obvious associativity and unitarity conditions. For an unbased reduced SC-operad we use collections without degenerate trees and define multiplication only with respect to surjections of coloured trees.
Definition 4.2 Let $\Lambda_{n}^{inj}$ be the category of pruned nondegenerate $n$-trees and their injective morphisms. A reduced $n$-collection is a contravariant functor $A$ from $\Lambda_{n}^{inj}$ to $V$ such that $A_{U_{n}}=I.$
Definition 9.1 A coloured pruned $n$-tree is a pruned $n$-tree $T$ equipped with a map of trees $\xi_{T}:T\longrightarrow M_{0}^{2}$ such that the induced $n$-ordinal structure on $\xi^{-1}(1)$ is a suspension over $(n-1)$-tree or a degenerate $n$-tree.
Definition 3.1 We call an $n$-operad pruned if this morphism is an identity for every full injection $\sigma.$
Definition 6.2 The dimension of an $n$-pruned tree $T\neq U_{n}$ is the integer $dim(T)=E(T)-n-1.$ We also put $dim(U_{n})=0.$
Definition 5.1.5 Let $A$ be a weakly unital $A_{\infty}$-algebra. An $A$-module $M$ is called weakly unital if the cohomology $H^{\bullet}(M,m_{1}^{M})$ is a unital $H^{\bullet}(A)$-module.
Definition 10.1.4 Let $(X,pt,Q,\omega)$ be a non-commutative formal pointed symplectic dg-manifold. A scalar product of degree $N$ on the $A_{\infty}$-algebra $A=T_{pt}X[-1]$ is given by a choice of affine coordinates at $pt$ such that the $\omega$ becomes constant and gives rise to a non-degenerate bilinear form $A\otimes A\to k[-N]$.
Definition 4.1.1 An $A_{\infty}$-algebra is called unital (or strictly unital) if there exists an element $1\in V$ of degree zero, such that $m_{2}(1,v)=m_{2}(v,1)$ and $m_{n}(v_{1},...,1,...,v_{n})=0$ for all $n\neq 2$ and $v,v_{1},...,v_{n}\in V$. It is called weakly unital (or homologically unital) if the graded associative unital algebra $H^{\bullet}(V)$ has a unit $1\in H^{0}(V)$.
Definition 3.1.1 A non-commutative thin differential-graded (dg for short) scheme is a pair $(X,d)$ where $X$ is a non-commutative thin scheme, and $d$ is a vector field on $X$ of degree $+1$ such that $[d,d]=0$.
Definition 5.1.2 A dg-vector bundle over a formal pointed dg-manifold $(X,d_{X},x_{0})$ is given by a linearly compact vector bundle ${\cal E}$ over $(X,x_{0})$ such that the corresponding module $\Gamma({\cal E})$ carries a differential $d_{\cal E}:\Gamma({\cal E})\to\Gamma({\cal E})[1],d_{\cal E}^{2}=0$ so that $(\Gamma({\cal E}),d_{\cal E})$ becomes a dg-module over the dg-algebra $({\cal O}(X),d_{X})$ and $d_{\cal E}$ vanishes on ${\cal E}_{x_{0}}$.
Definition 8.1.6 The bimodule $A^{!}$ is called the inverse dualizing bimodule.
Definition 3.1.5 A homomorphism of non-unital $A_{\infty}$-algebras ($A_{\infty}$-morphism for short) $(V,d_{V})\to(W,d_{W})$ is a homomorphism of differential-graded coalgebras $T_{+}(V[1])\to T_{+}(W[1])$.
Definition 12.1.1 The category of non-commutative affine $k$-schemes in $\cal{C}$ (notation $NAff_{{\cal C}}$) is the one opposite to the category of associative unital $k$-algebras in $\cal{C}$.
Definition 5.1.3 Let $A$ be a non-unital $A_{\infty}$-algebra. A left $A$-module $M$ is given by a dg-bundle $E$ over the formal pointed dg-manifold $X=Spc(T(A[1]))$ together with an isomorphism of vector bundles $\Gamma({\cal E})\simeq{\cal O}(X)\widehat{\otimes}M^{\ast}$ called a trivialization of ${\cal E}$.
Definition 12.1.4 A non-commutative ind-affine scheme $\hat{X}$ is called formal if it can be represented as $\hat{X}=\varinjlim Spec(A_{i})$, where $(A_{i})_{i\in I}$ is a projective system of associative unital algebras in $\cal{C}$ such that the homomorphisms $A_{i}\to A_{j}$ are surjective and have nilpotent kernels for all morphisms $j\to i$ in $I$.
Definition 9.1.1 We say that an $A_{\infty}$-algebra $A$ satisfies the degeneration property if for any $n\geq 1$ one has: $H^{\bullet}(C_{\bullet}^{mod,(n)}(A,A))$ is a flat $k[u]/(u^{n})$-module.
Definition 3.2.2 An $A_{\infty}$-algebra $A$ (or the corresponding non-commutative formal pointed dg-manifold) is called minimal if $m_{1}=0$. It is called contractible if $m_{n}=0$ for all $n\geq 2$ and $H^{\bullet}(A,m_{1})=0$.
Definition 11.6.1 An element of ${\cal M}(n,m)$ is an isomorphism class of triples $(\Sigma,h,mark)$ where $\Sigma$ is a compact oriented surface (not necessarily connected) with metric $h$, and $mark$ is an orientation preserving isometry between a neighborhood of $\partial\Sigma$ and the disjoint union of $n+m$ flat semiannuli $\sqcup_{1\leq i\leq n}(S^{1}\times[0,\varepsilon))\sqcup\sqcup_{1\leq i\leq m}% (S^{1}\times[-\varepsilon,0])$, where $\varepsilon$ is a sufficiently small positive number. We will call $n$ circle “inputs” and the rest $m$ circles “outputs”. We will assume that each connected component of $\Sigma$ has at least one input, and there are no discs among the connected components. Also we will add $\Sigma=S^{1}$ to ${\cal M}(1,1)$ as the identity morphism. It can be thought of as the limit of cylinders $S^{1}\times[0,\varepsilon]$ as $\varepsilon\to 0$.
Definition 4.2.3 Weak unit in $X$ is given by a morphism of non-commutative formal pointed dg-manifolds $p:X_{1}\to X$ such that $p\circ e=id$.
Definition 3.1.3 Non-unital $A_{\infty}$-algebra over $k$ is given by a non-commutative formal pointed dg-manifold $(X,x_{0},d)$ together with an isomorphism of counital coalgebras $B_{X}\simeq T(T_{x_{0}}X)$.
Definition 8.1.1 1) A perfect $A$-module is the one which is quasi-isomorphic to a direct summand of an extension of a sequence of modules each of which is quasi-isomorphic to $A[n],n\in{\bf Z}$. 2) A perfect $A-A$-bimodule is the one which is quasi-isomorphic to a direct summand of an extension of a sequence consisting of bimodules each of which is quasi-isomorphic to $(A\otimes A)[n],n\in{\bf Z}$.

Non-commutative thin scheme $X$ is called smooth if the corresponding counital coalgebra $B=B_{X}$ is smooth.
Definition 5.1.1 Linearly compact vector bundle ${\cal E}$ over $X$ is given by a linearly compact topologically free ${\cal O}(X)$-module $\Gamma({\cal E})$, where ${\cal O}(X)$ is the algebra of function on $X$. Module $\Gamma({\cal E})$ is called the module of sections of the linearly compact vector bundle ${\cal E}$.
Definition 8.1.2 We say that an $A_{\infty}$-algebra $A$ is homologically smooth if it is a perfect $A-A$-bimodule (equivalently, $A$ is a perfect module over the $A_{\infty}$-algebra $A``\otimes"A^{op}$).

Definition 2.3.4 Homomorphism $f:B_{1}\to B_{2}$ of counital coalgebras is called a minimal conilpotent extension if it is an inclusion and the induced coproduct on the non-counital coalgebra $B_{2}/f(B_{1})$ is trivial.
Definition 5.1.4 Let $A$ be an $A_{\infty}$-algebra and $M$ be a ${\bf Z}$-graded vector space. A structure of a left $A_{\infty}$-module on $M$ over $A$ (or simply a structure of a left $A$-module on $M$) is given by a differential $d_{M}$ of degree $+1$ on $T(A[1])\otimes M$ which makes it into a dg-comodule over the dg-coalgebra $T(A[1])$.
Definition 11.6.3 We define $R(n,m)$ as a graded vector space which is a direct sum $\oplus_{\Gamma}\psi_{\Gamma}$ of $1$-dimensional graded vector spaces generated by graphs $\Gamma$ as above, each summand has degree $deg\,\Gamma$.
Definition 4.1.2 Non-commutative formal dg-line ${\bf L}$ is a non-commutative formal pointed dg-manifold corresponding to the one-dimensional $A_{\infty}$-algebra $A\simeq k$ such that $m_{2}=id,m_{n\neq 2}=0$.

Definition 3.1.2 A non-commutative formal pointed dg-manifold is a pair $((X,x_{0}),d)$ such that $(X,x_{0})$ is a non-commutative formal pointed graded manifold, and $d=d_{X}$ is a homological vector field on $X$ such that $d|_{x_{0}}=0$.
Definition 7.2.1 a) The graded vector space ${\cal O}(T[1]X)=\Omega^{\bullet}(X)=\prod_{m\geq 0}\Omega^{m}(X)$ is called the space of de Rham differential forms on $X$. b) The graded space $\Omega^{0}_{cycl}(T[1]X)=\prod_{m\geq 0}\Omega^{m}_{cycl}(X)$ is called the space of cyclic differential forms on $X$.
Definition 12.1.2 Let $I$ be a small filtering category, and $F:I\to NAff_{{\cal C}}$ a covariant functor. We say that $``\varinjlim"F$ is a non-commutative ind-affine scheme if for a morphism $i\to j$ in $I$ the corresponding morphism $F(i)\to F(j)$ is a closed embedding.
