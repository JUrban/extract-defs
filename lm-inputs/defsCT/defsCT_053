Definition 5.1. A $\mathcal{V}$-category $\mathcal{M}$ is a $\mathcal{V}$-enriched model category if [MC1-5]: its underlying category $\mathcal{M}_{0}$ admits a model structure, [MC6]: it is tensored and cotensored over $\mathcal{V}$, and [MC7]: if $i\colon A\to B$ is a cofibration in $\mathcal{M}_{0}$ and $p\colon X\to Y$ is a fibration in $\mathcal{M}_{0}$, the map $(i^{*},p_{*})\colon\operatorname{Hom}_{\mathcal{M}}(B,X)\to\operatorname{Hom}_% {\mathcal{M}}(A,X)\times_{\operatorname{Hom}_{\mathcal{M}}(A,Y)}\operatorname{% Hom}_{\mathcal{M}}(B,Y)$ is a fibration in $\mathcal{V}$, which is trivial if either $i$ or $p$ is a weak equivalence.
Definition 2.4. Let $\alpha$ be a regular cardinal. A $\mathcal{V}$-category $\mathcal{A}$ is locally $\alpha$-presentable (in the enriched sense) if it is $\mathcal{V}$-cocomplete and it admits a strongly $\mathcal{V}$-generating family of (enriched) $\alpha$-presentable objects. We say that $\mathcal{A}$ is locally presentable if it is locally $\alpha$-presentable for some regular cardinal $\alpha$.
Definition 2.1. Let $\alpha$ be a regular cardinal. A locally $\alpha$-presentable base is a closed symmetric monoidal category $(\mathcal{V},\otimes,I)$ which admits a strongly generating family of $\alpha$-presentable objects containing the unit $I$ and closed under tensor products. We say that $\mathcal{V}$ is a locally presentable base if it is a locally $\alpha$-presentable base for some regular cardinal $\alpha$.
Definition 3.1. Let $D$ be a small $\mathrm{sSet}_{*}$-category. The simplicial category of objects of $D$ is the $\mathrm{sSet}_{*}$-category $\operatorname{Ob}D$ with the same objects as $D$, in which the hom-objects are given by $\begin{array}[]{lcr}\operatorname{Hom}_{\operatorname{Ob}D}(d,d^{\prime})=% \Delta^{0},&\text{ and }&\operatorname{Hom}_{\operatorname{Ob}D}(d,d)=S^{0},% \end{array}$ for every $d\neq d^{\prime}\in D$, and the identity morphisms are given by $\operatorname{id}_{d}=\operatorname{id}_{S^{0}}\colon S^{0}\longrightarrow% \operatorname{Hom}_{\operatorname{Ob}D}(d,d)=S^{0},$ for every $d\in D$. There is an inclusion $i\colon\operatorname{Ob}D\to D$ given by the $\mathrm{sSet}_{*}$-functor which is the identity on objects, and with $i_{d,d^{\prime}}\colon\operatorname{Hom}_{\operatorname{Ob}D}(d,d^{\prime})=% \Delta^{0}\longrightarrow\operatorname{Hom}_{D}(d,d^{\prime})$ corresponding to the inclusion of the basepoint, for every $d\neq d^{\prime}\in D$, and $i_{d,d}\colon\operatorname{Hom}_{\operatorname{Ob}D}(d,d)=S^{0}\longrightarrow% \operatorname{Hom}_{D}(d,d)$ corresponding to the identity morphism $\operatorname{id}_{d}$ in $D$, for every $d\in D$.
Definition 2.3. Let $\mathcal{A}$ be a $\mathcal{V}$-category. An object $A$ of $\mathcal{A}$ is $\alpha$-presentable (in the enriched sense) if the representable $\mathcal{V}$-functor $\operatorname{Hom}_{\mathcal{A}}(A,-)\colon\mathcal{A}\to\mathcal{V}$ preserves $\alpha$-filtered $\mathcal{V}$-colimits.
Definition 2.2. Let $(\mathbb{G},.,\leq)$ be an ordered groupoid and let $x,y\in\mathbb{G}$ are such that $e=\textbf{{r}}(x)\wedge\textbf{{d}}(y)$ is defined. Then the pseudoproduct of $x$ and $y$ is defined as follows: $x\otimes y=(x|e)(e|y).$
Definition 2.1. For an arbitrary inverse semigroup $S$, the restricted product (also called the $`$trace product’) of elements $x$ and $y$ of $S$ is $xy$ if $x^{-1}x=yy^{-1}$ and undefined otherwise.
Definition 4.3. Let $A$ be a prime space with the accumulation point $a$. Then $A_{\omega}$ is the space on the set $\bigcup_{n\in\mathbb{N}}A_{n}$ where $U\subseteq\bigcup_{n\in\mathbb{N}}A_{n}$ is open if and only if $U\cap A_{n}$ is open for every $n\in\mathbb{N}$.
Definition 6.1. For any infinite cardinal $\alpha$ we denote by $C(\alpha)$ the space on the set $\alpha\cup\{\alpha\}$ such that each $\beta\in\alpha$ is isolated and the sets $B_{\beta}=\{\xi\in\alpha\cup\{\alpha\};\xi\geq\beta\}$ for $\beta<\alpha$ form a local base at $\alpha$.
Definition 3.7. Let $Y$, $Z$ be topological spaces and $b\in Y$ be a point such that the set $\{b\}$ is closed in $Y$. We say that $P(b,Y,Z)$ holds if there exists an open local base $\mathcal{B}$ at $b$ in $Y$, a point $a\in Z$ and an open neighborhood $U_{0}$ of $a$ in $Z$ such that for any $V\in\mathcal{B}$ there exists a continuous map $f\colon Y\to Z$ with $f(b)=a$, $f^{-1}(U_{0})=V$.
Definition 3.4. We say that a subcategory $\mathbf{A}$ of $\mathbf{Top}$ is closed under $\bigtriangleup$ if $X\bigtriangleup_{b}Y\in\mathbf{A}$ whenever $X,Y\in\mathbf{A}$ and $b\in Y$.
Definition 4.1. Let $A$ be a prime space with the accumulation point $a$. Let us denote $B:=A\setminus\{a\}$. Suppose that for each $b\in B$ we are given a topological space $X_{b}$ and a point $x_{b}\in X_{b}$. Then the $A$-sum $\sum\limits_{A}\langle X_{b},x_{b}\rangle$ is the topological space on the set $F=A\cup(\bigcup\limits_{b\in B}\{b\}\times(X_{b}\setminus\{x_{b}\}))$ which is quotient with respect to the map $\varphi\colon A\sqcup(\coprod\limits_{b\in B}X_{b})\to F$, $\varphi(x)=x$ for $x\in A$, $\varphi(x)=(b,x)$ for $x\in X_{b}\setminus\{x_{b}\}$ and $\varphi(x_{b})=b$ for every $b\in B$.
Definition 6.9. Let $\alpha$ be a regular cardinal. Then $B(\alpha)$ is the topological space on the set $\alpha\cup\{\alpha\}$ whose open sets are precisely the sets $B_{\beta}=\{\xi\in\alpha\cup\{\alpha\};\xi\geq\beta\}$ for $\beta<\alpha$. We will denote the coreflective hull of $B(\alpha)$ in $\mathbf{Top}$ by $\mathbf{B}_{\alpha}$.
Definition 3.6. Let $X$, $Y$ be topological spaces and $b\in Y$ with the set $\{b\}$ closed in $Y$. The space $X\bigtriangledown_{b}Y$ is the topological space on the set $X\times Y$ which has the initial topology w.r.t. the family $h_{a}\colon X\times Y\to X\times Y$, $h_{a}(x,y)=(x,b)$ for $x\neq a$ and $h_{a}(a,y)=(a,y)$.
Definition 3.2. If $X$ and $Y$ are topological spaces, $b\in Y$ and $\{b\}$ is closed in $Y$, then we denote by $X\bigtriangleup_{b}Y$ the topological space on the set $X\times Y$ which has the final topology w.r.t the family of maps $\{f,g_{a};a\in X\}$, where $f\colon X\to X\times Y$, $f(x)=(x,b)$ and $g_{a}\colon Y\to X\times Y$, $g_{a}(y)=(a,y)$.

Definition 6.3. Let $\mathcal{B}$ be an abelian category and let $\mathcal{C}$ be a resolving subcategory. For a given integer $n\geq 0$, we will say that the subcategory $\mathcal{C}\subseteq\mathcal{B}$ is $n$-resolving if for each object $B\in\mathcal{B}$, there exists an exact sequence $0\longrightarrow C_{n}\longrightarrow C_{n-1}\longrightarrow\dots% \longrightarrow C_{1}\longrightarrow C_{0}\longrightarrow B\longrightarrow 0\\ $ in $\mathcal{B}$ with $C_{i}\in\mathcal{C}$ for each $0\leq i\leq n$.
Definition 3.8. Let $\mathcal{B}$ be an abelian category. A subcategory $\mathcal{B}^{\prime}\subseteq\mathcal{B}$ is said to be an abelian subcategory if $\mathcal{B}^{\prime}$ is also abelian and the inclusion functor $\mathcal{B}^{\prime}\hookrightarrow\mathcal{B}$ is exact. A full subcategory $\mathcal{B}^{\prime}\subseteq\mathcal{B}$ is a Serre subcategory if it is an abelian subcategory that is closed under extensions and subobjects. Equivalently a full and replete subcategory $\mathcal{B}^{\prime}\subseteq\mathcal{B}$ containing $0$ is said to be a Serre subcategory if it satisfies the following conditions. (a) $\mathcal{B}^{\prime}$ is closed under taking subobjects and quotients in $\mathcal{B}$. (b) $\mathcal{B}^{\prime}$ is closed under taking extensions in $\mathcal{B}$.
Definition 7.7. (see [15, $\lx@sectionsign$ 3]) Let $\mathcal{B}$ be an abelian category. A nonzero object $F\in\mathcal{B}$ is said to be quasi-final if it satisfies $F\prec B$ for any nonzero object $B\in\mathcal{B}$. An abelian category is said to be local if it contains a quasi-final object.
Definition 4.7. (see, for instance, [3, Chapter 1] Let $\mathcal{B}$ be an abelian category. A torsion pair $\tau$ on $\mathcal{B}$ consists of a pair $\tau=(\mathcal{T},\mathcal{F})$ of replete and full subcategories of $\mathcal{B}$ satisfying the following two conditions: (a) Given any objects $X\in\mathcal{T}$ and $Y\in\mathcal{F}$, we have $Hom_{\mathcal{B}}(X,Y)=0$. (b) For any object $M\in\mathcal{B}$, there exists a short exact sequence: $0\longrightarrow X_{M}\longrightarrow M\longrightarrow Y^{M}\longrightarrow 0$ in $\mathcal{B}$ such that $X_{M}\in\mathcal{T}$ and $Y^{M}\in\mathcal{F}$. The subcategory $\mathcal{T}$ is referred to as the torsion class whereas the subcategory $\mathcal{F}$ is referred to as the torsion free class of the torsion pair.

A $G$-sequence of length $n$ will be an $n$-tuple $\tilde{Y}=(Y_{1},Y_{2},...,Y_{n})$ of subsets of $\mathfrak{S}pec(\mathcal{A})$ satisfying the following conditions. (a) $Y_{1}\supseteq Y_{2}\supseteq...\supseteq Y_{n}$ (b) $Ass(\mho_{i-1}(G))\cap Y_{i}=\phi$ for all $1\leq i\leq n$.
Definition 4.6. Let $\mathcal{B}$ be an abelian category. (a) A full subcategory $\mathcal{B}^{\prime}\subseteq\mathcal{B}$ is said to be a torison class if it is closed under extensions and quotients. (b) A full abelian subcategory $\mathcal{B}^{\prime}\subseteq\mathcal{B}$ is said to be a thick subcategory if it is closed under extensions. (c) A narrow subcategory $\mathcal{B}^{\prime}\subseteq\mathcal{B}$ is a full subcategory that is closed under extensions and cokernels.
Definition 7.1. For $M\in\mathcal{A}$, put $E_{0}(M):=E(M)$ and $\mho_{0}(M):=M$. For $k\geq 1$, $E_{k}(M)$ and $\mho_{k}(M)$ are defined by setting: $\mho_{k}(M):=\mho(\mho_{k-1}(M))=E(\mho_{k-1}(M))/\mho_{k-1}(M)\qquad E_{k}(M)% :=E(\mho_{k}(M))$ For any $k<0$, we always set $\mho_{k}(M)=0$. For each $k\in\mathbb{Z}$, the object $\mho_{k}(M)$ is referred to as the $k$-th cosyzygy of $M$. The sequence $0\longrightarrow M\longrightarrow E_{0}(M)\longrightarrow E_{1}(M)% \longrightarrow E_{2}(M)\longrightarrow\dots$ is referred to as the minimal injective resolution of $M$.
Definition 3.4. For a full and replete subcategory $\mathcal{C}\subseteq\mathcal{A}_{fg}$, set: $Supp(\mathcal{C}):=\underset{M\in\mathcal{C}}{\bigcup}\textrm{ }Supp(M)$ Conversely, for a subset $S\subseteq\mathfrak{S}pec(\mathcal{A})$, set: $Supp^{-1}(S):=\{\mbox{$M\in\mathcal{A}_{fg}$ $|$ $Supp(M)\subseteq S$}\}% \subseteq\mathcal{A}_{fg}$
Definition 6.1. (see [20, $\lx@sectionsign$ Definition 2.1]) Let $\mathcal{B}$ be an abelian category. A full subcategory $\mathcal{C}\subseteq\mathcal{B}$ is said to be a resolving subcategory if it satisfies the following conditions: (1) The subcategory $\mathcal{C}$ is closed under taking direct summands. (2) Suppose that $0\longrightarrow M^{\prime}\longrightarrow M\longrightarrow M^{\prime\prime}\longrightarrow 0$ is a short exact sequence in $\mathcal{B}$ and that $M^{\prime\prime}\in\mathcal{C}$. Then, $M\in\mathcal{C}$ if and only if $M^{\prime}\in\mathcal{C}$. (3) The subcategory $\mathcal{C}$ is generating. In other words, for every object $B\in\mathcal{B}$, there exists an epimorphism $C\twoheadrightarrow B$ in $\mathcal{B}$ with $C\in\mathcal{C}$.
Definition 1.1 A quadratic module $(\omega,\partial_{2},\partial_{1})$ is a diagram
Definition 2.1 (Ultrafilter). A filter on a set $I$ is a collection $\mathcal{F}$ of sets which is closed under intersection and under supersets (i.e. if $U\subseteq V\subseteq I$ and $U\in\mathcal{F}$ then $V\in\mathcal{F}$). A filter is proper when $\emptyset\not\in\mathcal{F}$. An ultrafilter on $I$ is a proper filter such that for every $U\subseteq I$, either $U\in\mathcal{F}$ or $I\setminus U\in\mathcal{F}$. An ultrafilter $\mathcal{F}$ is principal when there exists $i\in I$ such that $\mathcal{F}=\{U\subseteq I\mid i\in U\}$, and non-principal otherwise.
Definition 1.11. A shared net $N=(P,O,s,t)$ from $m$ to $n$ consists of – a finite set $P$ of ports, – a finite set $O$ of operators which are pairs $(\alpha,(s_{i})_{i\in\langle\sigma(\alpha)\rangle})$ where $\alpha\in\Sigma$ is a symbol and $(s_{i})_{i\in\langle\sigma(\alpha)\rangle}$ is a family of ports called the sources of the operators, – a source function $s:\langle n\rangle\to P$, – an injective target function $t:T_{N}\to P$, where $T_{N}=\{(x,i)\mid x\in O,i\in\langle\tau\circ\lambda(x)\rangle\}\uplus\langle m\rangle$, such that for every operator $x\in O$, $s^{-1}(t(T_{x}))\neq\emptyset$ where $T_{x}=\{(x,i)\mid i\in\langle\tau\circ\lambda(x)\rangle\}$.
Definition 2.16 (Internal cpo). An internal cpo $(D,\leqslant)$ in a non-standard model consists of an internal set $D=\langle D_{i}\rangle$ and an internal relation $\leqslant=\langle\leqslant_{i}\rangle$ such that for every integer $i$, $(D_{i},\leqslant_{i})$ is a cpo. Similarly, an internal Scott-continuous function $f:D\to E$ between two internal cpo $D=\langle D_{i}\rangle$ and $E=\langle E_{i}\rangle$ consists of an internal function $\langle f_{i}:D_{i}\to E_{i}\rangle$ such that all the $f_{i}$ are continuous. We write $\mathbf{ICpo}$ for the category of internal cpo and internal Scott-continuous functions.
Definition 1.5. We write $\mathbf{Net}_{\Sigma}$ for the category $\mathbf{Net}_{\Sigma}$ whose objects are natural integers, morphisms $N:m\to n$ are isomorphism classes of nets, identities and composition are given by the constructions of Definition 1.4.
Definition 1.16 ($\Sigma$-object). Given a signature $\Sigma$, a $\Sigma$-object in a monoidal category $\mathcal{C}$ consists of an object $A$ together with a morphism $f_{\alpha}:\otimes^{\sigma(\alpha)}A\to\otimes^{\tau(\alpha)}A$ for every symbol $\alpha\in\Sigma$, called the interpretation of $\alpha$, where $\otimes^{n}A$ denotes the tensor product of $n$ copies of the object $A$. A $\Sigma$-morphism between two $\Sigma$-objects $(A,f_{\alpha})$ and $(B,g_{\alpha})$ consists of a morphism $h:A\to B$ such that for every $\alpha\in\Sigma$, $(\otimes^{\tau(\alpha)}h)\circ f_{\alpha}=g_{\alpha}\circ(\otimes^{\sigma(% \alpha)}h)$.
Definition 1.4. In order to define a category whose objects are integers and morphisms are nets (considered up to isomorphism), we introduce the following constructions: – Identity. The identity net $N:n\to n$ is the net such that $P=\langle n\rangle$, $O=\emptyset$ and $s,t:\langle n\rangle\to P$ are both the identity function. – Composition. Given two nets $M:n_{1}\to n_{2}$ and $N:n_{2}\to n_{3}$, their composite $N\circ M:n_{1}\to n_{3}$ is the net defined by $P=P_{M}\uplus P_{N}/\!\sim$ where $\sim$ is the smallest equivalence relation such that $s_{M}(k)\sim t_{N}(k)$ for every $k\in\langle n_{2}\rangle$, $O=O_{M}\uplus O_{N}$, $\lambda=\lambda_{M}\uplus\lambda_{N}$, $s$ is defined by $s(x,i)=s_{M}(x,i)$ if $x\in O_{M}$, $s(x,i)=s_{N}(x,i)$ if $x\in O_{N}$ and $s(k)=s_{N}(k)$ if $k\in\langle n_{3}\rangle$, and $t$ is defined similarly. – Tensor. Given two nets $M:m\to m^{\prime}$ and $N:n\to n^{\prime}$, their tensor product net $M\otimes N:m+n\to m^{\prime}+n^{\prime}$ is the net which is defined by $P=P_{M}\uplus P_{N}$, $O=O_{M}\uplus O_{N}$, $\lambda=\lambda_{M}\uplus\lambda_{N}$, $s$ is defined by $s(x,i)=s_{M}(x,i)$ if $x\in O_{M}$ and $s(x,i)=s_{N}(x,i)$ if $x\in O_{N}$, $s(k)=s_{M}(k)$ if $k\in\langle m^{\prime}\rangle$ and $s(k)=s_{N}(k-m^{\prime})$ if $k\in\langle n^{\prime}\rangle$, and $t$ is defined similarly. – Trace. Given a net $N:n_{1}+n\to n_{2}+n$, we define the net $\mathop{\mathrm{Tr}_{n_{1},n_{2}}^{n}}(N):n_{1}\to n_{2}$ by $P=P_{N}/\sim$ where $\sim$ is the smallest equivalence relation such that $s_{N}(n_{2}+k)=t_{N}(n_{1}+k)$ for every $k\in\langle n\rangle$, $O=O_{N}$, $\lambda=\lambda_{N}$, $s=q\circ s_{N}$ and $t=q\circ t_{N}$ where $q:P_{N}\to P$ is the canonical quotient map.
Definition 1.1 (Net). A net $N=(P,O,\lambda,s,t)$ from $m$ to $n$, with $m,n\in\mathbb{N}$, consists of – a finite set $P$ of ports, – a finite set $O$ of operators, – a labeling function $\lambda:O\to\Sigma$, – a source function $s:S_{N}\to P$ and an injective target function $t:T_{N}\to P$, where $S_{N}=\{(x,i)\mid x\in O,i\in\langle\sigma\circ\lambda(x)\rangle\}\uplus% \langle n\rangle\qquad\qquad T_{N}=\{(x,i)\mid x\in O,i\in\langle\tau\circ% \lambda(x)\rangle\}\uplus\langle m\rangle$ We sometimes write $N:m\to n$ to indicate that $N$ is a net from $m$ to $n$.
Definition 2.3 (Hyperreals). The set ${\hbox{}^{\ast}\mathbb{R}}$ of hyperreals is the set of equivalence classes (wrt $\equiv$) of countable sequences of reals.

Definition 2.20 (Infinitesimal-time domain). The infinitesimal-time domain is the internal complete partial order $IT={\hbox{}^{\ast}(\mathbb{R}^{\leqslant\mathbb{N}})}$.
Definition 2.15 (Continuous-time domain). The continuous-time domain is the complete partial order $CT=\mathbb{R}^{\leqslant\mathbb{R}^{+}}$. The continuous-time domain of continuous functions $CCT$ is the subdomain of $CT$ whose elements are continuous partial functions $\mathbb{R}^{+}\to\mathbb{R}$.
Definition 1.3. A morphism $\varphi:M\to N$ between two nets $M,N:m\to n$ (with the same source and target) consists of a pair of functions $\varphi_{P}:P_{M}\to P_{N}$ and $\varphi_{O}:O_{M}\to O_{N}$ such that for every operator $x\in O_{M}$, $\lambda_{N}(\varphi_{O}(x))=\lambda_{M}(x)$, for every source $(x,i)\in S_{M}$, $\varphi_{P}(s_{M}(x,i))=s_{N}(\varphi_{O}(x),i)$, for every $k\in\langle n\rangle$, $\varphi_{P}(s_{N}(k))=s_{M}(k)$ and similar equations for target functions. Two nets $M$ and $N$ are isomorphic when there exists an invertible morphism between them, which we write $M\approx N$.

The bifunctor $-\otimes-:\underline{\operatorname{Re}}\!\operatorname{p}_{0}(GL_{\delta})% \times\underline{\operatorname{Re}}\!\operatorname{p}_{0}(GL_{\delta})\to% \underline{\operatorname{Re}}\!\operatorname{p}_{0}(GL_{\delta})$ is defined as follows: On objects: Set $w_{1}\otimes w_{2}=w_{1}w_{2}$ (concatenation of words) for any objects $w_{1}$ and $w_{2}$ in $\underline{\operatorname{Re}}\!\operatorname{p}_{0}(GL_{\delta})$. On morphisms: Assume $w_{i}$ and $w_{i}^{\prime}$ are finite words in $\bullet$ and $\circ$, and $X_{i}$ is a $(w_{i},w_{i}^{\prime})$-diagram for $i=1,2$. Let $X_{1}\otimes X_{2}$ denote the $(w_{1}w_{2},w_{1}^{\prime}w_{2}^{\prime})$-diagram obtained by placing $X_{1}$ directly to the left of $X_{2}$. Now extend $\mathbb{K}$-linearly in both arguments to define tensor products of arbitrary morphisms in $\underline{\operatorname{Re}}\!\operatorname{p}_{0}(GL_{\delta})$.

Morphisms: $\operatorname{Hom}(w,w^{\prime})$ is the $\mathbb{K}$-vector space on basis $\{(w,w^{\prime})\text{-diagrams}\}$. Composition: $\operatorname{Hom}(w^{\prime},w^{\prime\prime})\times\operatorname{Hom}(w,w^{% \prime})\to\operatorname{Hom}(w,w^{\prime\prime})$ sending $(f,g)\mapsto fg$ is the $\mathbb{K}$-bilinear map satisfying $YX=\delta^{\ell(X,Y)}Y\cdot X$ whenever $X$ is a $(w,w^{\prime})$-diagram and $Y$ is a $(w^{\prime},w^{\prime\prime})$-diagram.

Definition 3.1. A symmetric monoidal category $(\mathcal{C},I,-\otimes-)$ is a category equipped with the following extra structure: a bifunctor $-\otimes-:\mathcal{C}\times\mathcal{C}\rightarrow\mathcal{C}$; a unit object $I$; and four natural isomorphisms, left and right unit: $\lambda_{A}:A\cong I\otimes A$, $\rho_{A}:A\cong A\otimes I$, associative: $\alpha_{A,B,C}:(A\otimes B)\otimes C\cong A\otimes(B\otimes C)$ and commutative: $\sigma_{A,B}:A\otimes B\cong B\otimes A$. Furthermore these objects and natural isomorphisms obey a series of coherence conditions [14].
Definition 4.3. The category MSpek is a sub-category of Rel, with the same objects as Spek. Its morphisms are all those relations generated by composition, Cartesian product and relational converse from the generators of Spek plus an additional generator: $\bot_{\textbf{MSpek}}:{\rm I}\rightarrow{\rm I}\hskip-1.13811pt{\rm V}::\{\ast% \}\sim\{1,2,3,4\}$

Definition 5.22. The IZ-set is the set of zones which are internalised in going from $D$ to $D^{\prime}$. The non-internalised adjacent zones (nIAZs) of an internalised zone are all the zones adjacent to it which are not themselves members of the IZ-set. An adjacency closure set (ACS) is a subset of the IZ-set with the minimal number of elements such that the disjoint union of the nIAZs of each element contains each nIAZ an even number of times.
