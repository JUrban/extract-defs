Definition 3.5 (Lax product structure). Given an ordered monoidal category $\mathbf{C}$, a lax product structure is a choice, for each object $C\in\mathbf{C}$, of commutative comonoid $(\Delta_{C},\bot_{C})$, compatible with the monoidal product in the obvious way, i.e.: $\Delta_{C\oplus D}=(\Delta_{C}\oplus\Delta_{D});(C\oplus\sigma_{C,D}\oplus D)% \qquad\bot_{C\oplus D}=\bot_{C}\oplus\bot_{D}$ such that for every arrow $\alpha:B\to C$ we have $\alpha;\Delta_{C}\leq\Delta_{B}\,;\,(\alpha\oplus\alpha)\quad\text{and}\quad% \alpha;\bot_{C}\leq\bot_{C}.$
Definition 2.2. A prop is a symmetric strict monoidal category with objects the natural numbers, where $\oplus$ on objects is addition. The prop freely generated by a theory $\mathbb{T}=(\Sigma,E)$, denoted by $\mathcal{P}_{\mathbb{T}}$, has as its set of arrows $n\to m$ the set of $\Sigma$-terms $n\to m$ taken modulo the laws of symmetric strict monoidal categories — Fig. 1 — and the smallest congruence (with respect to $\,;\,$ and $\oplus$) containing equations $t=t^{\prime}$ for any $(t,t^{\prime})\in E$.
Definition 2.6. A (presentation of a) cartesian theory is a pair $\mathbb{T}=(\Sigma,E)$ consisting of a signature $\Sigma$ and equations $E$. $\Sigma$ is a set of generators $o\colon n\to 1$ with arity $n$ and coarity $1$. The set of equations $E$ contains pairs $(t,t^{\prime}\colon n\to 1)$ of Cartesian $\Sigma$-terms, namely arrows of the prop freely generated by the SMT $(\Sigma\uplus\Sigma_{C},E_{C}\uplus E_{CH})$ where $E_{CH}$ contains equations $\lower 10.0pt\hbox{$\includegraphics[height=28.452756pt]{graffles/law1.pdf}$}=% \lower 10.0pt\hbox{$\includegraphics[height=28.452756pt]{graffles/law2.pdf}$}$ $\lower 10.0pt\hbox{$\includegraphics[height=28.452756pt]{graffles/law3.pdf}$}=% \lower 15.0pt\hbox{$\includegraphics[height=42.679134pt]{graffles/law4.pdf}$}$ for each generator $\raisebox{1.0pt}{\parbox{28.8pt}{\hbox{\includegraphics[height=18.0pt]{% graffles/operator.pdf}}}}\colon n\to 1$ of the signature $\Sigma$. The Lawvere category freely generated by a cartesian theory $\mathbb{T}=(\Sigma,E)$, denoted by $\mathcal{L}_{\mathbb{T}}$, is the prop freely generated by the SMT $(\Sigma\uplus\Sigma_{C},E\uplus E_{C}\uplus E_{CH})$. The latter will be often referred to as the SMT corresponding to the cartesian theory $(\Sigma,E)$.
Definition 3.1 (Ordered prop). An ordered prop is a prop enriched over the category of posets: that is, it is a strict symmetric 2-category $\mathbf{C}$ with objects the natural numbers, monoidal product on objects defined as $m\oplus n\stackrel{{\scriptstyle\mathrm{def}}}{{=}}m+n$, where each set of arrows $\mathbf{C}[m,n]$ is a poset, with composition and monoidal product monotonic. Similarly, a pre-ordered prop is a prop enriched over the category of pre-orders.
Definition 3.3 (Lax Product Theory). A (presentation of a) lax product theory (LPT) is a pair $\mathbb{T}=(\Sigma,I)$ consisting of a signature $\Sigma$ and a set of inequations $I$. The signature $\Sigma$ is a set of generators $o\colon n\to m$ with arity $n$ and coarity $m$. The set of inequations $I$ contains pairs $(t,t^{\prime}\colon n\to m)$ of L-$\Sigma$-terms, namely arrows of the ordered prop freely generated by the SMIT $(\Sigma\uplus\Sigma_{C},E_{C}\uplus E_{C}^{op}\uplus I_{LCH})$ where $I_{LCH}$ is the set containing for each generator $\sigma$ in $\Sigma$. We refer to $(\Sigma\uplus\Sigma_{C},I\uplus E_{C}\uplus E_{C}^{op}\uplus I_{LCH})$ as the SMIT corresponding to a LPT $\mathbb{T}=(\Sigma,I)$. The ordered prop freely generated by the SMIT corresponding to $\mathbb{T}$ is called the lax product prop freely generated by $\mathbb{T}$ and denoted by $\mathcal{LP}_{\mathbb{T}}$.
Definition 2.8. Given a cartesian category $\mathbf{C}$, a model of a cartesian theory $\mathbb{T}$ in $\mathbf{C}$ is a cartesian functor $F\colon\mathcal{L}_{\mathbb{T}}\to\mathbf{C}$. Then $\mathsf{Mod_{CAR}}(\mathbb{T},\mathbf{C})$ is the category of models of $\mathbb{T}$ in $\mathbf{C}$ and monoidal natural transformations between them.
Definition 2.1. A (presentation of a) symmetric monoidal theory (SMT) is a pair $\mathbb{T}=(\Sigma,E)$ consisting of a signature $\Sigma$ and a set of equations $E$. The signature $\Sigma$ is a set of generators $o\colon n\to m$ with arity $n$ and coarity $m$. The set of $\Sigma$-terms is obtained by composing generators in $\Sigma$, the unit $\operatorname{id}\colon 1\to 1$ and the symmetry $\sigma_{1,1}\colon 2\to 2$ with $;$ and $\oplus$. This is a purely formal process: given $\Sigma$-terms $t\colon k\to l$, $u\colon l\to m$, $v\colon m\to n$, one constructs new $\Sigma$-terms $t\mathrel{;}u\colon k\to m$ and $t\oplus v\colon k+n\to l+n$. The set $E$ of equations contains pairs $(t,t^{\prime}\colon n\to m)$ of $\Sigma$-terms with the same arity and coarity.
Definition 2.4. Given a symmetric monoidal category $\mathbf{C}$, a model of an SMT $\mathbb{T}$ in $\mathbf{C}$ is a symmetric monoidal functor $F\colon\mathcal{P}_{\mathbb{T}}\to\mathbf{C}$. Then $\mathsf{Mod_{SMT}}(\mathbb{T},\mathbf{C})$ is the category of models of $\mathbb{T}$ in $\mathbf{C}$ and monoidal natural transformations between them.
Definition 14. Let the $k$-ary term $q(z_{1},z_{2},\ldots z_{k})\in T_{\mathcal{F}}^{reg}(V)$ be constant free. Then we write $q(u_{1},u_{2},\ldots u_{k})\overset{\mathsf{H}^{\prime}\cup\mathsf{H}^{\prime-% 1}\cup\mathsf{I}_{A_{1}\cup A_{2}}}{\rightrightarrows}q(u_{1}^{\prime},u_{2}^{% \prime},\ldots u_{k}^{\prime})\text{,}$ if $(u_{i},u_{i}^{\prime})\in\mathsf{H}^{\prime}\dot{\cup}\mathsf{H}^{\prime-1}% \dot{\cup}\mathsf{I}_{A_{1}\dot{\cup}A_{2}}$ for all $1\leq i\leq k$, where $\mathsf{I}_{A_{1}\dot{\cup}A_{2}}$ is the diagonal relation.
Definition 8. We call the quotient $\widehat{\mathbf{T}(X)}=\overline{\mathbf{T}(X)}/\Sigma_{\leq}$ the ordered term algebra of type $\mathcal{F}$ over $(X,\leq_{X}),$ where $\Sigma_{\leq}$ is the compatible quasiorder on $\overline{\mathbf{T}(X)}$ generated by $\leq$.
Definition 11. We call $(\mathbf{C};\mathbf{A}_{1},\mathbf{A}_{2};\phi_{1},\phi_{2})$ a special amalgam if $\mathbf{A}_{1}$ is isomorphic to $\mathbf{A}_{2}$ via, say, $\nu:\mathbf{A}_{1}\longrightarrow\mathbf{A}_{2}$, such that $\phi_{2}=\nu\circ\phi_{1}$.
Definition 1 (see [1]). Given a type $\mathcal{F}$, an ordered $\mathcal{F}$-algebra is a triple $\mathbf{A}=(A,\mathcal{F}^{\mathbf{A}},\leq_{A})$, where $(A,\mathcal{F}^{\mathbf{A}})$ is an $\mathcal{F}$-algebra and $(A,\leq_{A})$ is a partially ordered set (briefly, poset), such that every $f^{\mathbf{A}}\in\mathcal{F}^{\mathbf{A}}$ is a monotone function, i.e., if $f\in\mathcal{F}_{k}$ and $a_{1},b_{1},\ldots,\,a_{k},b_{k}\in A$, then $\left(a_{1}\leq_{A}b_{1}\wedge\cdots\wedge a_{k}\leq_{A}b_{k}\right)% \Rightarrow f^{\mathbf{A}}\left(a_{1},\ldots,a_{k}\right)\leq_{A}f^{\mathbf{A}% }\left(b_{1},\ldots,b_{k}\right).$
Definition 10. Let $\mathcal{V}$ be a variety of ordered $\mathcal{F}$-algebras. An amalgam in $\mathcal{V}$ is a $\mathcal{V}$-diagram given in Figure 5, such that $\mathbf{A},\mathbf{B},\mathbf{C}\in\mathcal{V}$ are pairwise disjoint, and $\phi_{1}$, $\phi_{2}\in Hom(\mathcal{V})$, are order-embeddings.
Definition 3. Given a term $t\in T_{\mathcal{F}}(X)$, we define the tree of $\,t$, denoted by $Tree(t)$ as follows. (1) If $t\in X\cup\mathcal{F}_{0}$, then $Tree(t)$ is just one-node: (2) $Tree(fs_{1}s_{2}\dots s_{k})$ is depicted in Figure 1.
Definition 6. A term $t\in T_{\mathcal{F}}(V)$ is called regular if for some $n\geq 1$, $var(t)=(z_{1},z_{2},\dots,z_{n})$. We call $n$ the arity of the regular term $t$ and write $ar(t)=n$. The set of all regular terms of type $\mathcal{F}$ is denoted by $T_{\mathcal{F}}^{reg}(V)$.
Definition 4. Let $t\in T_{\mathcal{F}}(X)$, such that $Tree(t)$ has $n$ leaves. We define a function $leaf(t):\{1,\ldots,n\}\longrightarrow X\cup\mathcal{F}_{0}$ by $leaf(t)(i)=l_{i},$ where $l_{i}$ is the $i^{th}$ leaf label of $Tree(t)$.
Definition 2. Given a type $\mathcal{F}$ of algebras and a set $X$ of variables we define, by recursion on $n$, the sets $T_{n}$ of words on $X\cup\mathcal{F}$ by $\displaystyle T_{0}$ $\displaystyle=$ $\displaystyle\{w|w\in X\cup\mathcal{F}_{0}\}$ $\displaystyle T_{n+1}$ $\displaystyle=$ $\displaystyle T_{n}\cup\{fs_{1}s_{2}\dots s_{k}|f\in\mathcal{F}_{k},s_{1},s_{2% },\dots,s_{k}\in T_{n}\}.$ We, then, define $T_{\mathcal{F}}(X)=\cup_{n\in\mathbb{N}}T_{n}$, called the set of terms of type $\mathcal{F}$ over $X$.
Definition 7. Let $\mathbf{A}$ be an $\mathcal{F}$-algebra, and let $X\subseteq A$. The X-translations of $\mathbf{A}$ are the unary polynomials of $\mathbf{A}$ of the form $p(u)=t(a_{1},\dots,a_{i-1},u,a_{i+1},\ldots,a_{n})\,\,\mbox{for all}\,\,u\in A,$ where $t\in T_{\mathcal{F}}^{reg}(V)$ is of arity $n$ and $a_{1},\dots,a_{i-1},a_{i+1},\ldots,a_{n}\in X$.
Definition 13. Let $u_{1}^{\prime}=t_{1}^{\prime}\left(x_{1p_{1}}^{\prime},\ldots,x_{1q_{1}}^{% \prime}\right)$ and $u_{n}=t_{n}(x_{np_{n}},\ldots,x_{nq_{n}})$. We say that $u_{n}$ covers $u_{1}^{\prime}$ if $p_{n}\leq p_{1}$, $q_{1}\leq q_{n}$. Dually, one can say that $u_{1}^{\prime}$ covers $u_{n}$. If $p_{1}=p_{n}$, $q_{1}=q_{n}$, then $u_{1}^{\prime}$, $u_{n}$ are said to cover each other properly.
Definition 5. Given $t\in T_{\mathcal{F}}(X)$, we denote by $var(t)$ the sequence of variables of $t$, written in the same order as they appear on the leaves of $Tree(t)$.
Definition 12. Let $\mathbf{B}$ be a subalgebra of an ordered $\mathcal{F}$-algebra $\mathbf{A}$. The dominion of $\mathbf{B}$ in $\mathbf{A}$, denoted by $\widehat{Dom}_{\mathbf{A}}\mathbf{B}$, is the set of all elements $d\in A$ such that for every pair of homomorphisms of ordered $\mathcal{F}$-algebras $f,g:\mathbf{A}\longrightarrow\mathbf{C}$ satifying $f\left|{}_{B}\right.=g\left|{}_{B}\right.$ we have $f(d)=g(d)$.
Definition 9. Let $t(z_{1},\ldots,z_{k})\in T_{\mathcal{F}}^{reg}(V)$ be constant free such that $Tree(t)$ has $k$ leaves and $var(t)=(z_{1},\ldots,z_{k})$. For $a_{1},\ldots,a_{k}\in V\cup\mathcal{F}_{0}$ and $1\leq j\leq k$, we define $\displaystyle t(a_{1},\ldots,a_{j},\ldots,a_{k})\left[j\right]$ $\displaystyle=a_{j}$ $\displaystyle t(a_{1},\ldots,a_{j},\ldots,a_{k})\left\langle l\right\rangle$ $\displaystyle=(a_{1},\ldots,a_{l})\text{; \ \ }l\leq k$ $\displaystyle t(a_{1},\ldots,a_{j},\ldots,a_{k})[j,u]$ $\displaystyle=t(a_{1},\ldots,a_{j-1},u,a_{j+1},\ldots,a_{k}).$
Definition 1. A process $f$ is terminal if it satisfies: $g$$A$$f$$h$$B$$C$$A$$D$$A$$t$$f$$f$$=$ and a process theory is terminal if all its processes are.
Definition 1.3. A pair of functors ${\mathcal{A}}_{1}\xrightarrow{F_{1}}{\mathcal{A}}_{2}\xrightarrow{F_{3}}{% \mathcal{A}}_{3}$ is said to be a (Morita) short exact sequence of DG categories if the following conditions hold $\rm{i)}$ the composition $F_{2}F_{1}$ is homotopic to zero; $\rm ii)$ the functor $F_{1}$ is quasi-fully-faithful; $\rm iii)$ the induced quasi-functor $\overline{F_{2}}:{\mathcal{A}}_{2}/F_{1}({\mathcal{A}}_{1})\to{\mathcal{A}}_{3}$ is a Morita equivalence.
Definition B.3. Let $A$ be a DG algebra over $\mathrm{k}.$ 1) For $n\in\mathbb{Z},$ we denote by $D^{\leq n}(A)\subset D(A)$ (resp. $D^{\geq n}(A)\subset D(A)$) the full subcategory of DG $A$-modules $M$ such that $H^{>n}(M)=0$ (resp. $H^{<n}(M)=0$). We also put $D^{-}(A):=\bigcup\limits_{m\in\mathbb{Z}}D^{\leq m}(A),$ $D^{+}(A):=\bigcup\limits_{m\in\mathbb{Z}}D^{\geq m}(A)$ and $D^{b}(A):=D^{-}(A)\cap D^{+}(A).$ 2) A DG module $M\in D(A)$ is called ”$\operatorname{Tor}$-bounded above” if for some $m\in\mathbb{Z}$ we have $M\mathbin{\mathop{\otimes}\displaylimits^{{\mathbf{L}}}_{A}}D^{\leq 0}(A^{op})% \subset D^{\leq m}(\mathrm{k}).$ 3) A DG module $M\in D(A)$ is called ”projectively bounded above” if for some $m\in\mathbb{Z}$ we have ${\mathbf{R}}\operatorname{Hom}_{A}(M,D^{\geq 0}(A))\subset D^{\geq m}(\mathrm{% k}).$
Definition 3.3. Let ${\mathcal{B}}$ be a smooth DG category. 1) The (triangulated) DG category $\operatorname{Perf}_{top}(\widehat{{\mathcal{B}}}_{\infty}):=\operatorname{Ker% }(F_{{\mathcal{B}}}:{\mathbf{R}}\underline{\operatorname{Hom}}({\mathcal{B}}^{% op},\operatorname{Calk}_{\mathrm{k}})\to\operatorname{Calk}_{{\mathcal{B}}})$ is called the category of perfect complexes on the formal punctured neighborhood of infinity of ${\mathcal{B}}.$ 2) We define the DG subcategory $\operatorname{Perf}_{alg}(\widehat{{\mathcal{B}}}_{\infty})\subset% \operatorname{Perf}(\widehat{{\mathcal{B}}}_{\infty})$ to be generated as a triangulated DG subcategory by the image of $\overline{{\mathbf{Y}}}:{\mathcal{B}}\to\operatorname{Perf}_{top}(\widehat{{% \mathcal{B}}}_{\infty}).$ It is called the category of algebraizable perfect complexes on the formal punctured neighborhood of infinity of ${\mathcal{B}}.$ 3) Finally, we define the DG category $\widehat{{\mathcal{B}}}_{\infty}$ to be the essential image of $\overline{{\mathbf{Y}}}.$
Definition 9.1. Let $Y$ be a separated scheme of finite type over $\mathrm{k}.$ We denote by ${\mathbb{D}}_{Y}\in D^{b}_{coh}(Y)$ the dualizing complex. An object ${\mathcal{E}}\in D^{b}_{coh}(Y)$ is $!$-perfect if the complex ${\mathbf{R}}\mathcal{H}om_{{\mathcal{O}}_{Y}}({\mathcal{F}},{\mathcal{D}}_{Y})$ is perfect. We denote by $D_{!-\operatorname{perf}}(Y)\subset D^{b}_{coh}(Y)$ (resp. $!-Perf(Y)\subset{\mathfrak{D}}^{b}_{coh}(Y)$) the full (DG) subcategory formed by $!$-perfect complexes.
Definition 2.1. The DG category $\operatorname{Perf}(\widehat{X}_{Z})\in\operatorname{dgcat}_{k}$ of (non-algebraizable) perfect complexes on the formal scheme $\widehat{X}_{Z}$ is defined as the homotopy limit $\operatorname*{holim}\limits_{n}\operatorname{Perf}(Z_{n}).$We put $D_{\operatorname{perf}}(\widehat{X}_{Z}):=[\operatorname{Perf}(\widehat{X}_{Z}% )].$
Definition B.2. Let ${\mathcal{T}}$ be a compactly generated triangulated category, such that there exist a single compact generator $G\in{\mathcal{T}}^{c}.$ Suppose that we have $\operatorname{Hom}^{n}(G,G)=0$ for $n>>0$ (this property does not depend on the choice of a generator). An object $E\in{\mathcal{T}}$ is called compactly approximable if for any $l\in\mathbb{Z}$ there exists a compact object $F\in{\mathcal{T}}^{c}$ and a morphism $\varphi:F\to E$ which induces isomorphisms $\operatorname{Hom}^{i}(G,F)\xrightarrow{\sim}\operatorname{Hom}^{i}(G,E)$ for $i>l.$
Definition 5.3. [CQ, Definition 3.3 and Proposition 6.1] A $\mathrm{k}$-algebra $A$ is formally smooth if the following equivalent conditions are satisfied: $\rm{(i)}$ For any $\mathrm{k}$-algebra $B$ and a nilpotent ideal $I\subset B,$ any homomorphism $f:A\to B/I$ can be lifted to a homomorphism $\tilde{f}:A\to B.$ $\rm{(ii)}$ The projective dimension of the diagonal bimodule $A\in A\text{-Mod-}A$ is at most $1.$ $\rm{(ii)}$ The bimodule of differentials $\Omega_{A}=\operatorname{Ker}(A\otimes A\xrightarrow{m}A)$ is projective.
Definition \thechapter.1. A morphism of learning algorithms is a map between their parameter spaces such that the relevant diagrams commute. That is, suppose we have learners $(P,I,U,r)$ and $(Q,J,V,s)\colon A\to B$. A morphism $f\colon(P,I,U,r)\to(Q,J,V,s)$ is a function $f\colon P\to Q$ such that $\displaystyle J(f(p),a)$ $\displaystyle=I(p,a),$ $\displaystyle V(f(p),a,b)$ $\displaystyle=f(U(p,a,b)),$ $\displaystyle s(f(p),a,b)$ $\displaystyle=r(p,a,b).$ Composition of morphisms of learners is simply given by composition of functions.
Definition \thechapter.1. The category $\mathsf{NNet}$ of neural networks has as objects natural numbers and as morphisms $n\to m$ neural networks of type $(n,m)$. Composition is given by concatenation of neural networks. The identity morphism on $n$ is the $0$-layer neural network.
Definition \thechapter.1. Let $A$ and $B$ be sets. A learning algorithm $A\to B$ is a tuple $(P,I,U,r)$ where $P$ is a set, and $I$, $U$, and $r$ are functions of types: $\displaystyle I$ $\displaystyle\colon P\times A\to B,$ $\displaystyle U$ $\displaystyle\colon P\times A\times B\to P,$ $\displaystyle r$ $\displaystyle\colon P\times A\times B\to A.$
Definition \thechapter.1. We write $\mathsf{ParaFn}$ for the prop whose morphisms $n\to m$ are equivalence classes of differentiable parametrised functions $\mathbb{R}^{n}\to\mathbb{R}^{m}$. Composition of $I\colon n\to m$ and $J\colon m\to\ell$ is given by $(I\ast J)(q,p,a)=J(q,I(p,a)),$ while the monoidal product of $I\colon n\to m$ and $J\colon\ell\to k$ is given by $(I{\rm Phys.~{}Rev.~{}Lett.}J)(p,q,a,c)=\big{(}I(p,a),J(q,c)\big{)}.$
Definition 2.1 (Dual groups in the sense of Lewin) Let $\text{\rm Sym}(S)$ be the symmetric group on the set $S$. Two subgroups $G$ and $H$ of the symmetric group $\text{\rm Sym}(S)$ are called dual if their natural actions on $S$ are simply transitive and each is the centralizer of the other, that is, $C_{\text{\rm Sym}(S)}(G)=H\;\;\text{ and }\;\;C_{\text{\rm Sym}(S)}(H)=G.$
Definition 4.1. [Gau03a] A non-contracting topological $1$-category $X$ is a pair of compactly generated topological spaces $(X^{0},\mathbb{P}X)$ together with continuous maps $s$, $t$ and $*$ satisfying the same properties as in the definition of flow except that $X^{0}$ is not necessarily discrete. The corresponding category is denoted by ${\rm{\mathbf{1Cat^{top}_{1}}}}$.
Definition 7.3. Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a cofibrantly generated model category equipped with a closed symmetric monoidal structure $\otimes$. Let $I$ be the set of generating cofibrations and let $J$ be the set of generating acyclic cofibrations. Then $\mathcal{C}$ together with $\otimes$ is a monoidal model category if the following conditions hold: (1) The monoidal structure $\otimes$ is a Quillen bifunctor, which means here that any morphism of $I\square I$ is a cofibration and that any morphism of $I\square J$ and $J\square I$ is an acyclic cofibration. (2) Let $q:QS\rightarrow S$ be the cofibrant replacement for the unit $S$ of $\otimes$. Then the natural morphism $q\otimes Id_{X}:QS\otimes X\rightarrow S\otimes X$ is a weak equivalence for any $X$.
Definition 3.6. [Gau03a] The directed segment $\overrightarrow{I}$ is the flow defined as follows: $\overrightarrow{I}^{0}=\{0,1\}$, $\mathbb{P}\overrightarrow{I}=\{[0,1]\}$, $s=0$ and $t=1$.
Definition 3.1. A flow $X$ consists of a topological space $\mathbb{P}X$, a discrete space $X^{0}$, two continuous maps $s$ and $t$ from $\mathbb{P}X$ to $X^{0}$ and a continuous and associative map $*:\{(x,y)\in\mathbb{P}X\times\mathbb{P}X;t(x)=s(y)\}\longrightarrow\mathbb{P}X$ such that $s(x*y)=s(x)$ and $t(x*y)=t(y)$. A morphism of flows $f:X\longrightarrow Y$ consists of a set map $f^{0}:X^{0}\longrightarrow Y^{0}$ together with a continuous map $\mathbb{P}f:\mathbb{P}X\longrightarrow\mathbb{P}Y$ such that $f(s(x))=s(f(x))$, $f(t(x))=t(f(x))$ and $f(x*y)=f(x)*f(y)$. The corresponding category will be denoted by ${\rm{\mathbf{Flow}}}$.
Definition 3.4. For $X$ a flow, a point $\alpha$ of $X^{0}$ such that there are no non-constant execution paths $\gamma$ such that $t\left(\gamma\right)=\alpha$ (resp. $s\left(\gamma\right)=\alpha$) is called initial state (resp. final state).
Definition 3.9. [Gau03a] A morphism of flows $f:X\rightarrow Y$ is said synchronized if and only if it induces a bijection of sets between the $0$-skeleton of $X$ and the $0$-skeleton of $Y$.
Definition 3.5. [Gau03a] Let $Z$ be a topological space. Then the globe of $Z$ is the flow ${\rm{Glob}}(Z)$ defined as follows: ${\rm{Glob}}(Z)^{0}=\{0,1\}$, $\mathbb{P}{\rm{Glob}}(Z)=Z$, $s=0$, $t=1$ and the composition law is trivial.
Definition 4.2 A 2-vector space is an internal category in Vect.
Definition 5.1 A two dimensional extended TQFT is a functor from semistrict monoidal 2-category of 2-cob to semistrict monoidal 2-category 2Vect of 2-vector spaces.
Definition 8.1. A $k$-finitely fibred space over $B$ is an object $f:X\longrightarrow B$ of $\mathsf{Ho}^{k}\mathcal{S}/B$ such that $X$ is an EM-type space and $\mathrm{C}^{*}X$ is a compact object in $\mathsf{D}(\mathrm{C}^{*}B)$. Note that we consider $\mathrm{C}^{*}X$ as a $\mathrm{C}^{*}B$-module via the map of $\mathbb{S}$-algebras $\mathrm{C}^{*}(f)$.
Definition 8.6. Define a relation $\smile_{B}$ on $\mathsf{F}/B$. For $X,Y\in\mathsf{F}/B$ we say that $X\smile_{B}Y$ if: (1) $Y\approx_{B}\mathcal{PO}X$, or (2) there exists $\phi:X\to Y$ in $\mathcal{S}/B$ which induces an injection in cohomology. We extend $\smile_{B}$ to be the equivalence relation generated from these conditions. Taking equivalence classes under $\smile_{B}$ yields a new partially ordered set, $\mathsf{F}^{\prime}/B$. However, in $\mathsf{F}^{\prime}/B$ it could still be that for two elements $X$ and $Y$ in $\mathsf{F}^{\prime}/B$ both $X\preceq Y$ and $Y\preceq X$ but $X\neq Y$. We therefore take equivalence classes again, this time identifying elements $X,Y\in\mathsf{F}^{\prime}/B$ satisfying $X\preceq Y\preceq X$. The reduced poset of finitely fibred spaces over $B$, denoted $\overline{\mathsf{F}/B}$, is the resulting poset.
Definition 7.1. A connected space of EM-type $X$ is spherically odd complete intersections (soci) if there is a connected space $B$ such that $H^{*}B$ is a graded polynomial ring on finitely many even degree generators and there are fibrations $S^{n_{1}}\longrightarrow X_{1}\longrightarrow X_{0}=B,\quad S^{n_{2}}% \longrightarrow X_{2}\longrightarrow X_{1},\ \ldots\ ,\quad S^{n_{c}}% \longrightarrow X_{c}\longrightarrow X_{c-1}$ with $X=X_{c}$ and $n_{i}$ is odd and greater than 1 for all $i=1,...,c$.
Definition 5.5. A morphism $U\to V$ of objects in $\mathsf{D}$ is an $A$-equivalence if the induced map $\hom_{\mathsf{D}}^{*}(A,U)\to\hom_{\mathsf{D}}^{*}(A,V)$ is an isomorphism. An object $N$ is $A$-null if $\hom_{\mathsf{D}}^{*}(A,N)=0$. An object $M$ is $A$-colocal if, for every $A$-null object $N$, $\hom_{\mathsf{D}}^{*}(M,N)=0$. If $C\to M$ is an $A$-equivalence and $C$ is $A$-colocal then $C$ is called an $A$-colocalization of $M$. It is easy to see that an $A$-colocalization of an object $M$ is unique up to isomorphism.
Definition 5.6. Let $A$ be an $R$-algebra with a unit map $u:R\to A$ and let $I$ be defined by the exact triangle $I\to R\to A$ Denote by $I^{\otimes n}$ the tensor product $\underbrace{I\otimes_{R}I\cdots\otimes_{R}I}_{n\text{ times}}$ Taking the tensor product of $u$ with itself $n$ times yields a morphism $I^{\otimes n}\to R$. Let $R/I^{\otimes n}$ be defined by the exact triangle $I^{\otimes n}\to R\to R/I^{\otimes n}$ In particular, $R/I\cong A$.
Definition 8.3. Given $X$ and $Y$ in $\mathsf{Ho}^{k}\mathcal{S}/B$ we say that $X\preceq Y$ if there is a morphism $X\to Y$ in $\mathsf{Ho}^{k}\mathcal{S}/B$. This relation is clearly reflexive and transitive. If $X\preceq Y$ and $Y\preceq X$ then we say that $X$ is congruent (over $B$) to $Y$ and denote this by $X\approx_{B}Y$. The poset of finitely fibred spaces over $B$, denoted $\mathsf{F}/B$, has for elements congruence classes of finitely fibred spaces in $\mathsf{Ho}^{k}\mathcal{S}/B$ and the relation $\preceq$ gives the partial order on $\mathsf{F}/B$.
