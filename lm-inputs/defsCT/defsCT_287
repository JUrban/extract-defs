Definition 3.8. An adjacency space $(X,R)$ is called a topological adjacency space (abbreviated as TAS) if $X$ is a topological space and $R$ is a closed relation on $X$. When $X$ is a compact Hausdorff zero-dimensional space (i.e., when $X$ is a Stone space), we say that the topological adjacency space $(X,R)$ is a Stone adjacency space. Two topological adjacency spaces $(X,R)$ and $(X_{1},R_{1})$ are said to be TAS-isomorphic if there exists a homeomorphism $f:X\longrightarrow X_{1}$ such that, for every $x,y\in X$, $xRy$ iff $f(x)R_{1}f(y)$.
Definition 9.1. An extension of a space $X$ is a pair $(Y,f)$, where $Y$ is a space and $f:X\longrightarrow Y$ is a dense embedding of $X$ into $Y$. Two extensions $(Y_{i},f_{i}),\ i=1,2$, of $X$ are called isomorphic (or equivalent) if there exists a homeomorphism $\varphi:Y_{1}\longrightarrow Y_{2}$ such that $\varphi\circ f_{1}=f_{2}$. Clearly, the relation of isomorphism is an equivalence in the class of all extensions of $X$; the equivalence class of an extension $(Y,f)$ of $X$ will be denoted by $[(Y,f)]$. We write $(Y_{1},f_{1})\leq(Y_{2},f_{2})$ and say that the extension $(Y_{2},f_{2})$ is projectively larger than the extension $(Y_{1},f_{1})$ if there exists a continuous mapping $f:Y_{2}\longrightarrow Y_{1}$ such that $f\circ f_{2}=f_{1}$. This relation is a preorder (i.e., it is reflexive and transitive). Setting for every two extensions $(Y_{i},f_{i}),\ i=1,2$, of a space $X$, $[(Y_{1},f_{1})]\leq[(Y_{2},f_{2})]$ iff $(Y_{1},e_{1})\leq(Y_{2},e_{2}),$ we obtain a well-defined relation on the class of all, up to equivalence, extensions of $X$; obviously, it is also a preorder (see, e.g., [3]). We write $(Y_{1},f_{1})\leq_{in}(Y_{2},f_{2})$ and say that the extension $(Y_{2},f_{2})$ is injectively larger than the extension $(Y_{1},f_{1})$ if there exists a continuous mapping $f:Y_{1}\longrightarrow Y_{2}$ such that $f\circ f_{1}=f_{2}$ and $f$ is a homeomorphism from $Y_{1}$ to the subspace $f(Y_{1})$ of $Y_{2}$. This relation is a preorder. Setting for every two extensions $(Y_{i},f_{i}),\ i=1,2$, of a space $X$, $[(Y_{1},f_{1})]\leq_{in}[(Y_{2},f_{2})]$ iff $(Y_{1},e_{1})\leq_{in}(Y_{2},e_{2}),$ we obtain a well-defined relation on the class of all, up to equivalence, extensions of $X$; obviously, it is also a preorder (see, e.g., [3]).
Definition 7.2. (2-Contact spaces.) (a) A topological pair $(X,X_{0})$ is called a 2-contact space (abbreviated as CS) if the following conditions are satisfied: $(CS1)$ $X$ is a $T_{0}$-space; $(CS2)$ $X_{0}$ is a Stone space; $(CS3)$ $RC(X,X_{0})$ is a closed base for $X$; $(CS4)$ If $\Gamma\in Clans(CO(X_{0}),\delta_{(X,X_{0})})$ (see (19) for the notation $\delta_{(X,X_{0})}$) then there exists a point $x\in X$ such that $\Gamma=\Gamma_{x,X_{0}}$ (see (9) for $\Gamma_{x,X_{0}}$). A 2-contact space $(X,X_{0})$ is called connected if the space $X$ is connected. (b) Let $(X,X_{0})$ be a 2-contact space. Then the contact algebra ${\underline{B}^{c}(X,X_{0})}=(RC(X,X_{0}),C_{(X,X_{0})})$ (see Lemma 4.3(a) for the notation $C_{(X,X_{0})}$) is said to be the canonical contact algebra of the 2-contact space $(X,X_{0})$. (c) Let $\underline{B}=(B,C)$ be a contact algebra, $X=Clans(B,C)$, $X_{0}=Ult(B)$ and $\tau$ be the topology on $X$ described in Definition 5.1. Take the subspace topology on $X_{0}$. Then the pair $\underline{X}^{c}(\underline{B})=(X,X_{0})$ is called the canonical 2-contact space of the contact algebra $(B,C)$. (d) Let $(X,X_{0})$ and $(\widehat{X},\widehat{X}_{0})$ be two 2-contact spaces. We say that $(X,X_{0})$ and $(\widehat{X},\widehat{X}_{0})$ are CS-isomorphic (or, simply, isomorphic) if there exists a homeomorphism $f:X\longrightarrow\widehat{X}$ such that $f(X_{0})=\widehat{X}_{0}$.
Definition 3.3. Let $\underline{B}=(B,C)$ be a precontact algebra and let $U_{1},U_{2}$ be ultrafilters of $B$. We set $U_{1}R_{\underline{B}}U_{2}\mbox{ iff }(\forall a\in U_{1})(\forall b\in U_{2}% )(aCb)\ \ (\mbox{i.e., iff }U_{1}\times U_{2}\subseteq C).$ The relational system $(Ult(B),R_{\underline{B}})$ is called the canonical adjacency space of $\underline{B}$. We say that $U_{1},U_{2}$ are connected iff $U_{1}(R_{\underline{B}})^{\flat}U_{2}$ (see (1) for the notation $R^{\flat}$).
Definition 7.17. ([6]) A semiregular $T_{0}$-space $(X,\tau)$ is said to be C-semiregular if for every clan $\Gamma$ in $(RC(X),C_{X})$ there exists a point $x\in X$ such that $\Gamma=\sigma_{x}$ (see (9) for $\sigma_{x}$).
Definition 8.16. Let $(X,X_{0})$ and $(X^{\prime},X_{0}^{\prime})$ be two Stone 2-spaces and $f:X\longrightarrow X^{\prime}$ be a continuous map. Then $f$ is called a 2-map if $f(X_{0})\subseteq X_{0}^{\prime}$. The category of all Stone 2-spaces and all 2-maps between them will be denoted by ${\bf 2Stone}$. The category of all Boolean algebras and all Boolean homomorphisms between them will be denoted by ${\bf Bool}$.
Definition 4.5. (2-Precontact spaces.) (a) A triple $\underline{X}=(X,X_{0},R)$ is called a 2-precontact space (abbreviated as PCS) if the following conditions are satisfied: $(PCS1)$ $(X,X_{0})$ is a topological pair and $X$ is a $T_{0}$-space; $(PCS2)$ $(X_{0},R)$ is a Stone adjacency space; $(PCS3)$ $RC(X,X_{0})$ is a closed base for $X$; $(PCS4)$ For every $F,G\in CO(X_{0})$, $\mbox{{\rm cl}}_{X}(F)\cap\mbox{{\rm cl}}_{X}(G)\neq\emptyset$ implies that $F(C_{R})^{\#}G$ (see (2) for $C_{R}$); $(PCS5)$ If $\Gamma\in Clans(CO(X_{0}),C_{R})$ then there exists a point $x\in X$ such that $\Gamma=\Gamma_{x,X_{0}}$ (see (9) for $\Gamma_{x,X_{0}}$). (b) Let $\underline{X}=(X,X_{0},R)$ be a 2-precontact space. Define, for every $F,G\in RC(X,X_{0})$, $F\ C_{\underline{X}}\ G\iff((\exists x\in F\cap X_{0})(\exists y\in G\cap X_{0% })(xRy)).$ Then the precontact algebra $\underline{B}(\underline{X})=(RC(X,X_{0}),C_{\underline{X}})$ is said to be the canonical precontact algebra of $\underline{X}$. (c) A 2-precontact space $\underline{X}=(X,X_{0},R)$ is called reflexive (resp., symmetric; transitive) if the relation $R$ is reflexive (resp., symmetric; transitive); $\underline{X}$ is called connected if the space $X$ is connected. (d) Let $\underline{X}=(X,X_{0},R)$ and $\widehat{\underline{X}}=(\widehat{X},\widehat{X}_{0},\widehat{R})$ be two 2-precontact spaces. We say that $\underline{X}$ and $\widehat{\underline{X}}$ are PCS-isomorphic (or, simply, isomorphic) if there exists a homeomorphism $f:X\longrightarrow\widehat{X}$ such that: (ISO1) $f(X_{0})=\widehat{X}_{0}$; and (ISO2) $(\forall x,y\in X_{0})(xRy\leftrightarrow f(x)\widehat{R}f(y))$.
Definition 2.1. An algebraic system $\underline{B}=(B,C)$ is called a precontact algebra ([9]) (abbreviated as PCA) if the following holds: $\bullet$ $B=(B,0,1,+,.,*)$ is a Boolean algebra (where the complement is denoted by $``*$”); $\bullet$ $C$ is a binary relation on $B$ (called a precontact relation) satisfying the following axioms: $(C0)$ If $aCb$ then $a\not=0$ and $b\not=0$; $(C+)$ $aC(b+c)$ iff $aCb$ or $aCc$; $(a+b)Cc$ iff $aCc$ or $bCc$. A precontact algebra $(B,C)$ is said to be complete if the Boolean algebra $B$ is complete. Two precontact algebras $\underline{B}=(B,C)$ and $\underline{B_{1}}=(B_{1},C_{1})$ are said to be PCA-isomorphic (or, simply, isomorphic) if there exists a PCA-isomorphism between them, i.e., a Boolean isomorphism $\varphi:B\longrightarrow B_{1}$ such that, for every $a,b\in B$, $aCb$ iff $\varphi(a)C_{1}\varphi(b)$. The negation of the relation $C$ is denoted by $(-C)$. For any PCA $(B,C)$, we define a binary relation $``\ll_{C}$” on $B$ (called non-tangential inclusion) by $\ a\ll_{C}b\leftrightarrow a(-C)b^{*}.$ Sometimes we will write simply $``\ll$” instead of $``\ll_{C}$”. We will also consider precontact algebras satisfying some additional axioms: If $a\not=0$ then $aCa$ (reflexivity axiom); If $aCb$ then $bCa$ (symmetry axiom); If $a\ll_{C}c$ then $(\exists b)(a\ll_{C}b\ll_{C}c)$ (transitivity axiom); If $a\not=0,1$ then $aCa^{*}$ or $a^{*}Ca$ (connectedness axiom). A precontact algebra $(B,C)$ is called a contact algebra ([6]) (and $C$ is called a contact relation) if it satisfies the axioms $(Cref)$ and $(Csym)$. We say that two contact algebras are CA-isomorphic if they are PCA-isomorphic; also, a PCA-isomorphism between two contact algebras will be called a CA-isomorphism. A precontact algebra $(B,C)$ is called connected if it satisfies the axiom $(Ccon)$.
Definition 8.2. (Stone 2-spaces.) (a) A topological pair $(X,X_{0})$ is called a Stone 2-space (abbreviated as S2S) if it satisfies conditions (CS1)-(CS3) of Definition 7.2 and the following condition: $(S2S4)$ If $\Gamma\in Grills(CO(X_{0}))$ then there exists a point $x\in X$ such that $\Gamma=\Gamma_{x,X_{0}}$ (see (9) for $\Gamma_{x,X_{0}}$). (b) Let $(X,X_{0})$ and $(\widehat{X},\widehat{X}_{0})$ be two Stone 2-spaces. We say that $(X,X_{0})$ and $(\widehat{X},\widehat{X}_{0})$ are S2S-isomorphic (or, simply, isomorphic) if there exists a homeomorphism $f:X\longrightarrow\widehat{X}$ such that $f(X_{0})=\widehat{X}_{0}$.
Definition 3.7. Let $X$ be a non-empty topological space and $R$ be a binary relation on $X$. Then the pair $(CO(X),C_{R})$ (see (2) for $C_{R}$) is a precontact algebra (by Proposition 2.5(a)), called the canonical precontact algebra of the relational system $(X,R)$.
Definition 8.18. (a) Let ${\bf ECS}$ be the category whose objects are all extremally connected spaces and whose morphisms are all continuous maps between the objects of ${\bf ECS}$ which preserve u-points (i.e., for every $X,Y\in|{\bf ECS}|$, $f\in{\bf ECS}(X,Y)$ iff $f$ is a continuous map and for every u-point $x\in X$, $f(x)$ is an u-point of $Y$). (b) Let ${\bf CBool}$ be the full subcategory of the category ${\bf Bool}$, whose objects are all complete Boolean algebras.
Definition 5.1. Let $\underline{B}=(B,C)$ be a precontact algebra. We associate with $\underline{B}$ a 2-precontact space $\underline{X}(\underline{B})=(X,X_{0},R),$ called the canonical 2-precontact space of $\underline{B}$, as follows: $\bullet$ $X=Clans(\underline{B})$ and $X_{0}=Ult(B)$; $\bullet$ The topology $\tau$ on the set $X$ is defined in the following way: the family $\{g_{B}(a)\ |\ a\in B\},$ where, for any $a\in B$, $g_{B}(a)=\{\Gamma\in X\ |\ a\in\Gamma\},$ is a closed base of $\tau$. The topology on $X_{0}$ is the subspace topology induced by $(X,\tau)$. $\bullet$ $R=R_{\underline{B}}$ (see (3) for the notation $R_{\underline{B}}$).
Definition 3.1. Let $\underline{B}=(B,C)$ be a precontact algebra. A non-empty subset $\Gamma$ of $B$ is called a clan if it satisfies the following conditions: $(Clan1)$ $0\not\in\Gamma$; $(Clan2)$ If $a\in\Gamma$ and $a\leq b$ then $b\in\Gamma$; $(Clan3)$ If $a+b\in\Gamma$ then $a\in\Gamma$ or $b\in\Gamma$; $(Clan4)$ If $a,b\in\Gamma$ then $aC^{\#}b$. The set of all clans of a precontact algebra $\underline{B}$ is denoted by $Clans(\underline{B})$.
Definition 7.13. Let $(X,{\cal T})$ be a topological space and $x\in X$. The point $x$ is said to be an u-point if for every $U,V\in{\cal T}$, $x\in\mbox{{\rm cl}}(U)\cap\mbox{{\rm cl}}(V)$ implies that $x\in\mbox{{\rm cl}}(U\cap V)$.
Definition 4.2. (a) Let $X$ be a topological space and $X_{0}$ be a dense subspace of $X$. Then the pair $(X,X_{0})$ is called a topological pair. (b) Let $(X,X_{0})$ be a topological pair. Then we set $RC(X,X_{0})=\{cl_{X}(A)\ |\ A\in CO(X_{0})\}.$
Definition 8.8. (Extremally connected spaces.) A semiregular $T_{0}$-space $X$ is called an extremally connected space (abbreviated as ECS) if for every grill $\Gamma$ in $RC(X)$ there exists a point $x\in X$ such that $\Gamma=\sigma_{x}$ (see (9) for $\sigma_{x}$).
Definition 5.4. An arrow $h\colon A\to B$ in $\sf MV$ is separating if $\operatorname{Max}(h)\colon\operatorname{Max}{B}\to\operatorname{Max}{A}$ is a monomorphism.
Definition 4.2. A $\delta$-algebra is an algebra $(A,\delta,\oplus,\neg,0)$ such that $(A,\oplus,\neg,0)$ is an MV-algebra, and the following identities are satisfied. A1 ${\rm d}\left(\delta(\vec{x}),\delta(x_{1},\vec{0})\right)=\delta(0,x_{2},x_{3}% ,\ldots)$. A2 $\operatorname{\mathnormal{f}_{\frac{1}{2}}}(\delta(\vec{x}))=\delta(% \operatorname{\mathnormal{f}_{\frac{1}{2}}}(x_{1}),\operatorname{\mathnormal{f% }_{\frac{1}{2}}}(x_{2}),\ldots)$. A3 $\delta\left(x,x,\ldots\right)=x$. A4 $\delta(0,\vec{x})=\operatorname{\mathnormal{f}_{\frac{1}{2}}}(\delta(\vec{x}))$. A5 $\delta(x_{1}\oplus y_{1},x_{2}\oplus y_{2},\ldots)\geqslant\delta(x_{1},x_{2},\ldots)$. A6 $\operatorname{\mathnormal{f}_{\frac{1}{2}}}(x\ominus y)=\operatorname{% \mathnormal{f}_{\frac{1}{2}}}(x)\ominus\operatorname{\mathnormal{f}_{\frac{1}{% 2}}}(y)$.
Definition 4.4. We let $\sf\Delta$ denote the category whose objects are $\delta$-algebras and whose morphisms are $\delta$-homomorphisms.
Definition 2.1. Suppose that $C$ is a finite category consisting of a finite number of objects and morphisms. We denote the set of objects of $C$ by $\mathrm{ob}(C)$, and the set of morphisms from $x$ to $y$ by $C(x,y)$. 1. The similarity matrix of $C$ is the function $\zeta:\mathrm{ob}(C)\times\mathrm{ob}(C)\to\mathbb{Q}$, given by the cardinality of each set of morphisms: $\zeta(a,b)=C(a,b)^{\sharp}$. 2. Let $u:\mathrm{ob}(C)\to\mathbb{Q}$ denote the column vector with $u(a)=1$, for any object $a$ of $C$. A weighting on $C$ is a column vector $w:\mathrm{ob}(C)\to\mathbb{Q}$ such that $\zeta w=u$, and dually, a coweighting on $C$ is a row vector $v:\mathrm{ob}(C)\to\mathbb{Q}$ such that $v\zeta=u^{\ast}$, where $u^{\ast}$ is the transposition of the matrix $u$.
Definition 2.5. Let $C$ be a small category. A filter $D$ is a full subcategory of $C$ such that an object $y$ of $C$ belongs to $D$ whenever $C(x,y)\not=\emptyset$ for some object $x$ of $D$. Dually, an ideal $D$ of $C$ is a full subcategory such that an object $y$ of $C$ belongs to $D$ whenever $C(y,x)\not=\emptyset$ for some object $x$ of $D$. in other words, a full subcategory $D$ of $C$ is an ideal if and only if the opposite category $D^{\mathrm{op}}$ is a filter of $C^{\mathrm{op}}$.
Definition 3.2. A map $f:C\to D$ on objects is called definable if it preserves the reflexible relation. That is, $f(x)\sim f(y)$ in $D$ for any reflexible pair $x\sim y$ in $C$. In particular, a definable map $C\to\mathbb{Q}$ is called a definable function on $C$. Here, we regard the set of rational numbers $\mathbb{Q}$ as a totally ordered set in the canonical order. Therefore, a definable function sends a reflexible pair to the same value. Let $\mathrm{DF}(C)$ denote the $\mathbb{Q}$-vector space of definable functions on $C$. For a poset $P$, every $\mathbb{Q}$-valued function on $P$ is definable, and hence, the vector space $\mathrm{DF}(P)$ consists of $\mathbb{Q}$-valued functions on $P$.
Definition 3.7. A finite category $C$ is called measurable if each filter and ideal of $C$ has Euler characteristic.
Definition 3.4. Let $B$ be a full subcategory of a category $C$, and let $f:C\to\mathbb{Q}$ be a function on objects. The clipping of $f$ on $B$ is the function $f_{B}:C\to\mathbb{Q}$ defined by $f_{B}(x)=f(x)$ if $x\in\mathrm{ob}(B)$, and $f_{B}(x)=0$ otherwise. This should not be confused with the restriction $f_{|B}$, whose domain is $B$. The clipping $\delta_{B}$ of the constant function $\delta:C\to\mathbb{Q}$ onto $1\in\mathbb{Q}$ is called the incidence function on $B$. The incidence function on $B$ is definable if $B$ is either a filter or an ideal of $C$.
Definition 3.8. For a measurable category $C$, the Euler integration on filters is the linear map $\int_{C}^{\mathcal{F}}(-)d\chi:\mathrm{DF}(C)\longrightarrow\mathbb{Q},$ which sends $\delta_{\vee x}$ to $\chi(\vee x)$. Dually, the Euler integration on ideals is the linear map $\int_{C}^{\mathcal{I}}(-)d\chi:\mathrm{DF}(C)\longrightarrow\mathbb{Q},$ that sends $\delta_{\wedge x}$ to $\chi(\wedge x)$.
Definition 2.2 ([Lei08]). Let $C$ be a finite category. We say that $C$ has Euler characteristic if it has both a weighting $w$ and a coweighting $v$ on $C$. Then, the Euler characteristic of $C$ is defined by $\chi(C)=\sum_{i\in\mathrm{ob}(C)}w(i)=\sum_{j\in\mathrm{ob}(C)}v(j).$
Definition 3.1. Let $C$ be a small category. 1. Two objects $x$ and $y$ of $C$ are reflexible if $C(x,y)\neq\emptyset$ and $C(y,x)\neq\emptyset$. In this case, let us denote $x\sim y$. We then have an equivalence relation on the set of objects of $C$. The quotient set $\mathcal{P}(C)$ is equipped with a partial order that is defined by $[x]\leq[y]$ if $C(x,y)\neq\emptyset$. Here, this order does not depend on the choice of representing objects. 2. Let $\vee x$ denote the prime filter generated from an object $x$ of $C$, i.e., it consists of ending objects of morphisms starting at $x$: $\vee x=\{y\in\mathrm{ob}(C)\mid C(x,y)\neq\emptyset\}.$ Dually, let $\wedge x$ denote the prime ideal generated from $x$ and consisting of starting objects of morphisms ending at $x$. 3. An object $x$ of $C$ is called maximal if it satisfies either $C(x,y)=C(y,x)=\emptyset$ or $C(y,x)\neq\emptyset$ for any object $y$. Dually, a minimal object $x$ of $C$ satisfies either $C(x,y)=C(y,x)=\emptyset$ or $C(x,y)\neq\emptyset$ for any object $y$.
Definition 3.13. Let $C$ and $D$ be categories. A map $F:C\to D$ is called measurable when the inverse image $F^{-1}(-)$ preserves filters and ideals.
Definition 3.15. Let $F:C\to D$ be a measurable map between measurable categories $C$ and $D$. The pushforward of $F$ is the homomorphism $F_{\ast}:\mathrm{DF}(C)\to\mathrm{DF}(D)$ defined by $F_{\ast}f(d)=\int_{F^{-1}(\wedge d)}fd\chi$ for $f\in\mathrm{DF}(C)$ and $d\in\mathrm{ob}(D)$.
Definition 40. A map $p:\widetilde{X}\to X$ is a $\Delta$-covering map if (1) $\widetilde{X}\in\Delta\mathbf{Top_{0}}$, (2) for every space $Y\in\Delta\mathbf{Top_{0}}$, point $\tilde{x}\in\widetilde{X}$, and based map $f:(Y,y)\to(X,p(\tilde{x}))$ such that $f_{\ast}(\pi_{1}(Y,y))\subset p_{\ast}(\pi_{1}(\widetilde{X},\tilde{x}))$, there is a unique map $\widetilde{f}:(Y,y)\to(\widetilde{X},\tilde{x})$ such that $p\circ\widetilde{f}=f$.
Definition 9. A subgroup $H\subseteq\pi_{1}(X,x_{0})$ is a $\mathcal{C}$-covering subgroup if there exists a $\mathcal{C}$-covering map $p:(\widetilde{X},\tilde{x})\to(X,x_{0})$ such that $p_{\ast}(\pi_{1}(\widetilde{X},\tilde{x}))=H$.
Definition 62. Let $(J,\leq)$ be a directed set and $K=J\cup\{\infty\}$ be obtained by adding one maximal point. Give $K$ the topology generated by basis sets $\{k\}$ and $V_{k}=\{\infty\}\cup\{j\in J|j>k\}$ for $k<\infty$. The directed arc-fan over $J$ is the cone over $K$, i.e. the quotient space $F(J)=K\times[0,1]/K\times\{0\}$ with basepoint $b_{0}$, the image of $K\times\{0\}$ in the quotient.
Definition 1. A map $f:X\to Y$ has the unique path lifting property if for any two paths $\alpha,\beta:[0,1]\to X$, we have $\alpha=\beta$ whenever $f\circ\alpha=f\circ\beta$ and $\alpha(0)=\beta(0)$.
Definition 47. [12] Let $(J,\leq)$ be an infinite directed set. The directed wedge $(A,a_{0})=\bigvee_{J}(X_{j},x_{j})$ of spaces $(X_{j},x_{j})$ indexed by $J$ is the based wedge sum with the following topology: $U\subset A\backslash\{a_{0}\}$ is open if and only if $U\cap X_{j}$ is open in $X_{j}$ for each $j\in J$ and $U$ is an open neighborhood of $a_{0}$ if and only if there is a $k\in J$ such that $X_{j}\subset U$ for all $j>k$ and $U\cap X_{j}$ is open in $X_{j}$ for each $j\in J$. The arc-hedgehog over $J$ is the directed wedge $(H(J),a_{0})=\bigvee_{J}([0,1]_{j},0)$.
Definition 4. A subgroup $H\subseteq\pi_{1}(X,x_{0})$ is a disk-covering subgroup if there is a disk covering $p:(E,e)\to(X,x)$ with $p_{\ast}(\pi_{1}(E,e))=H$.
Definition 66. [4] A map $f:X\to Y$ has continuous lifting of paths if for every $x\in X$, the induced map $f_{\#}:P(X,x)\to P(Y,f(x))$ is a homeomorphism.
Definition 12. The coreflective hull of $\mathcal{C}$ in $\mathbf{Top_{0}}$ is the full subcategory $\mathscr{H}(\mathcal{C})$ of $\mathbf{Top_{0}}$ consisting of all path-connected spaces which are the quotient of a topological sum of objects of $\mathcal{C}$.
Definition 6. Let $\mathcal{C}\subseteq\mathbf{Top_{0}}$ be a full subcategory of non-empty, path-connected spaces having the unit disk $D^{2}$ as an object. A $\mathcal{C}$-covering map is a map $p:\widetilde{X}\to X$ such that (1) $\widetilde{X}\in\mathcal{C}$, (2) For every space $Y\in\mathcal{C}$, point $\tilde{x}\in\widetilde{X}$, and based map $f:(Y,y)\to(X,p(\tilde{x}))$ such that $f_{\ast}(\pi_{1}(Y,y))\subseteq p_{\ast}(\pi_{1}(\widetilde{X},\tilde{x}))$, there is a unique map $\widetilde{f}:(Y,y)\to(\widetilde{X},\tilde{x})$ such that $p\circ\widetilde{f}=f$. We call $p$ a universal $\mathcal{C}$-covering if $\widetilde{X}$ is simply connected. Furthermore, we call $p$ a weak $\mathcal{C}$-covering map if $p$ only satisfies condition 2.
Definition 2. A map $p:E\to X$ is a disk-covering if $E$ is non-empty, path-connected and if for every $e\in E$ and map $f:(D^{2},d)\to(X,p(e))$, there is a unique map $\widehat{f}:(D^{2},d)\to(E,e)$ such that $p\circ\widehat{f}=f$.
Definition 38. A subset $U\subseteq X$ is $\Delta$-open in $X$ if $f^{-1}(U)$ is open in $D^{2}$ for every map $f:D^{2}\to X$. A space $X$ is $\Delta$-generated if a set $U$ is open in $X$ if and only if $U$ is $\Delta$-open in $X$.
Definition 49. A map $p:\widetilde{X}\to X$ is a $\mathbf{lpc_{0}}$-covering map if (1) $\widetilde{X}$ is path-connected and locally path-connected, (2) for every path-connected, locally path-connected space $Y$, point $\tilde{x}\in\widetilde{X}$, and based map $f:(Y,y)\to(X,p(\tilde{x}))$ such that $f_{\ast}(\pi_{1}(Y,y))\subset p_{\ast}(\pi_{1}(\widetilde{X},\tilde{x}))$, there is a unique map $\widetilde{f}:(Y,y)\to(\widetilde{X},\tilde{x})$ such that $p\circ\widetilde{f}=f$.
Definition 2.1. Let $k$ be a commutative ring with unit. A differential graded Lie algebra (DGLA) is a differential $\mathbb{Z}$-graded $k$-module $(L,d)$ with a bracket $[\cdot,\cdot]:L^{i}\times L^{j}\rightarrow L^{i+j}$ which satisfies the following properties: 1. it is skew-symmetric: $[\alpha,\beta]=-(-1)^{|\alpha||\beta|}[\beta,\alpha];$ 2. satisfies the graded Leibniz rule: $d([\alpha,\beta])=(-1)^{|\beta|}[d\alpha,\beta]+[\alpha,d\beta];$ 3. and the graded Jacobi identity: $(-1)^{(|\alpha|-1)(|\gamma|-1)}[[\alpha,\beta],\gamma]+(-1)^{(|\beta|-1)(|% \alpha|-1)}[[\beta,\gamma],\alpha]+(-1)^{(|\gamma|-1)(|\beta|-1)}[[\gamma,% \alpha],\beta]=0,$ where $\alpha,\beta,\gamma$ are arbitrary homogeneous elements in $(L,d)$ and $|\alpha|$ is the degree of the homogeneous element $\alpha$.
Definition 2.4. A Gerstenhaber module of $\mathcal{H}^{*}$ is a $\mathbb{Z}$-graded vector space $\mathcal{F}^{*}$ equipped with: 1. a module structure $\cup^{\prime}$ for the graded algebra $(\mathcal{H}^{*},\cup)$; 2. a module structure $[\cdot,\cdot]^{\prime}$ for the graded Lie algebra $(\mathcal{H}^{*}[-1],[\cdot,\cdot])$. That is, $[[\alpha,\beta],x]^{\prime}=[\alpha,[\beta,x]^{\prime}]^{\prime}-(-1)^{(|% \alpha|-1)(|\beta|-1)}[\beta,[\alpha,x]^{\prime}]^{\prime};$ 3. compatibility: $[\alpha\cup\beta,x]^{\prime}=(-1)^{|\alpha|(|x|-1)}\alpha\cup^{\prime}[\beta,x% ]^{\prime}+(-1)^{(|\alpha|+|x|-1)|\beta|}\beta\cup^{\prime}[\alpha,x]^{\prime},$ $[\alpha,\beta\cup^{\prime}x]^{\prime}=\beta\cup^{\prime}[\alpha,x]^{\prime}+(-% 1)^{|x|(|\alpha|-1)}[\alpha,\beta]\cup^{\prime}x$ where $\alpha,\beta$ are arbitrary homogeneous elements in $\mathcal{H}^{*}$ and $x$ is arbitrary homogeneous element in $\mathcal{F}^{*}$.
Definition 2.6. Let $(\mathcal{H}^{*},\cup,[\cdot,\cdot])$ be a Gerstenhaber algebra over a commutative ring $k$. Let $(\mathcal{F}_{1}^{*},\cup_{1},[\cdot,\cdot]_{1})$ and $(\mathcal{F}^{*}_{2},\cup_{2},[\cdot,\cdot]_{2})$ be two Gerstenhaber modules of $\mathcal{H}^{*}$. We say that a $k$-module morphism $\varphi:\mathcal{F}^{*}_{1}\rightarrow\mathcal{F}^{*}_{2}$ is a Gerstenhaber morphism of degree $r,(r\in\mathbb{Z})$ if the following two conditions are satisfied 1. $\varphi$ is a module morphism of degree $r$ for the graded commutative algebra $(\mathcal{H}^{*},\cup)$. That is, for any $f\in\mathcal{H}^{m}$ and $g\in\mathcal{F}_{1}^{*}$, $\varphi(f\cup_{1}g)=(-1)^{mr}f\cup_{2}\varphi(g)$ 2. $\varphi$ is a module morphism of degree $r$ for the graded Lie algebra $(\mathcal{H}^{*}[-1],[\cdot,\cdot]).$ That is, for any $f\in\mathcal{H}^{m}$ and $g\in\mathcal{F}_{1}^{*}$, $\varphi([f,g]_{1})=(-1)^{(m-1)r}[f,\varphi(g)]_{2}.$
Definition 2.3. A Gerstenhaber algebra is a $\mathbb{Z}$-graded $k$-module $\mathcal{H}^{*}:=\oplus_{n\in\mathbb{Z}}\mathcal{H}^{n}$ equipped with: 1. a graded commutative associative product $\cup$ of degree zero, with unit $1\in\mathcal{H}^{0}$, In particular, $\alpha\cup\beta=(-1)^{|\alpha||\beta|}\beta\cup\alpha$; 2. a graded Lie algebra structure $[\cdot,\cdot]$ on $\mathcal{H}^{*}[-1]$, that is, $[\alpha,\beta]=-(-1)^{(|\alpha|-1)(|\beta|-1)}[\beta,\alpha]$ and $(-1)^{(|\alpha|-1)(|\gamma|-1)}[[\alpha,\beta],\gamma]+(-1)^{(|\beta|-1)(|% \alpha|-1)}[[\beta,\gamma],\alpha]+(-1)^{(|\gamma|-1)(|\beta|-1)}[[\gamma,% \alpha],\beta]=0;$ 3. compatibility between $\cup$ and $[\cdot,\cdot]$: $[\alpha,\beta\cup\gamma]=\beta\cup[\alpha,\gamma]+(-1)^{|\gamma|(|\alpha|-1)}[% \alpha,\beta]\cup\gamma,$ (or equivalently, $[\alpha\cup\beta,\gamma]=[\alpha,\gamma]\cup\beta+(-1)^{|\alpha|(|\gamma|-1)}% \alpha\cup[\beta,\gamma])$ where $\alpha,\beta,\gamma$ are arbitrary homogeneous elements in $\mathcal{H}^{*}$ and $|\alpha|$ is the degree of the homogeneous element $\alpha$.
