(6) If $A$ is of the form $\partial_{i+2}[(x\wedge_{i+1}y)\wedge_{i+1}(y\wedge_{i}z)]$, then the equality $A\wedge_{i}(w\wedge_{i+1}\partial_{i}A)=(\partial_{i+3}A\wedge_{i}w)\wedge_{i+% 2}A$ holds whenever either side is defined. (7) If $i\leq j-3$ then the equality $(x\wedge_{i}y)\wedge_{j}(z\wedge_{i}w)=(x\wedge_{j-1}z)\wedge_{i}(y\wedge_{j-1% }w)$ holds whenever either side is defined.

Definition A.1. 1) An exact category ${\mathcal{A}}$ is called a Frobenious category if it has enough injective objects, enough projective objects, and these two classes of objects coincide. 2) If ${\mathcal{A}}$ is a Frobenious exact category, its stable triangulated category $\underline{{\mathcal{A}}}$ is defined as follows. First, $Ob(\underline{{\mathcal{A}}})=Ob({\mathcal{A}}).$ Further, for $X,Y\in{\mathcal{A}}$ the abelian group of morphisms $\operatorname{Hom}_{\underline{{\mathcal{A}}}}(X,Y)$ is defined as the quotient of $\operatorname{Hom}_{{\mathcal{A}}}(X,Y)$ by the subgroup of morphisms which are compositions $X\to I\to Y$ for some projective-injective object $I\in{\mathcal{A}}.$ The composition is induced by that in ${\mathcal{A}}.$ The shift functor is defined by choosing a conflation $0\to X\to I\to X[1]\to 0,$ for each $X\in Ob(\underline{{\mathcal{A}}}).$ Further, each triangle is isomorphic to a standard one $(\bar{i},\bar{p},\bar{e}),$ given by a morphism of conflation $(i,p)$ $\begin{CD}0@>{}>{}>X@>{i}>{}>Y@>{p}>{}>Z@>{}>{}>0\\ @V{\operatorname{id}}V{}V@V{}V{}V@V{e}V{}V\\ 0@>{}>{}>X@>{}>{}>I@>{}>{}>X[1]@>{}>{}>0.\end{CD}$
