Definition 3.1 (Frobenius algebra). A not necessarily associative and not necessarily unital algebra $Y\in\mathbf{cat}(2,1)$ is said to be a Frobenius algebra if exists a morphism $\cup\in\mathbf{cat}(2,0)$ such that the following two conditions hold $\displaystyle Y\circ\cup=\cup\circ Y\quad\in\mathbf{cat}(3,0)$ $\displaystyle\cup\circ\cap=\cap\circ\cup=\arrowvert=\operatorname{id}\quad\in% \mathbf{cat}(1,1).$ Within graphical or graphics language, the first of the above Frobenius condition (a solvable Frobenius algebra if $\cup\neq 0$) is precisely the relation among two morphisms from $\mathbf{cat}(3,0)$ as follows $\sim$
Definition 10.7. Let $\cal C$ and $\cal D$ be preorders. A monotone map $f:{\cal C}\to{\cal D}$ is said to be flat if the following two conditions hold: (i) For any $d\in{\cal D}$ there exists $c\in{\cal C}$ such that $d\leq f(c)$; (ii) For any element $d\in{\cal D}$ and any elements $c,c^{\prime}\in{\cal C}$ such that $d\leq f(c)$ and $d\leq f(c^{\prime})$ there exists $c^{\prime\prime}\in{\cal C}$ such that $c^{\prime\prime}\leq c$, $c^{\prime\prime}\leq c^{\prime}$ and $d\leq f(c^{\prime\prime})$.
Definition 3.15. (a) Given a topos-theoretic invariant property $C$ of families of subobjects of a given object in a (locally small cocomplete) topos, an object $A$ of a topos is said to be $C$-compact if and only if any covering family of subobjets of $A$ in $\cal E$ has a refinement by a family of subobjects satisfying the property $C$; (b) Given a topos-theoretic invariant $C$ of families of subterminals in a topos (equivalently, by Remark 3.14, a locale-theoretic invariant of families of elements of a locale), an element $l$ of a locale $L$ (equivalently, of the corresponding locale) is said to be $C$-compact if every covering family of $l$ in $L$ has a refinement satisfying $C$; that is, whenever $a=\mathbin{\mathop{\textrm{\huge$\vee$}}\limits_{i\in I}}a_{i}$ in $L$ there exists a family $\{b_{j}\leq a\textrm{ | }j\in J\}$ of elements of $L$ satisfying $C$ such that for every $j\in J$ there exists $i\in I$ such that $b_{j}\leq a_{i}$, and the join $\mathbin{\mathop{\textrm{\huge$\vee$}}\limits_{i\in I}}a_{i}$ in $L$ is equal to the join $\mathbin{\mathop{\textrm{\huge$\vee$}}\limits_{j\in J}}b_{j}$ in $L$.
Definition 2.5. Let $({\cal C},J)$ be a site. (a) A $J$-ideal on $\cal C$ is a subset $I\subseteq ob({\cal C})$ such that for any arrow $f:b\to a$ in $\cal C$ if $a\in I$ then $b\in I$, and for any $J$-covering sieve $R$ on an object $c$ of $\cal C$, if $dom(f)\in I$ for every $f\in R$ then $c\in I$; we denote by $Id_{J}({\cal C})$ the set of $J$-ideals on $\cal C$, endowed with the subset-inclusion order relation. If $J$ is the trivial topology on $\cal C$, we call the $J$-ideals on $\cal C$ simply ideals, and we denote $Id_{J}({\cal C})$ by $Id({\cal C})$. (b) Given an object $c$ of $\cal C$, we the principal $J$-ideal $(c)\downarrow_{J}$ generated by $c$ is the smallest $J$-ideal on $\cal C$ containing the object $c$, that is the collection of all the objects $d\in{\cal C}$ such that there exists a $J$-covering sieve $R$ on $d$ with the property that for every $f\in R$ there exists an arrow $dom(f)\to c$ in $\cal C$. (c) Let $({\cal C},\leq)$ be a preorder category. A $J$-prime filter on $\cal C$ is a subset $F\subseteq ob({\cal C})$ such that $F$ is non-empty, $a\in F$ implies $b\in F$ whenever $a\leq b$ in $\cal C$, for any $a,b\in F$ there exists $c\in F$ such that $c\leq a$ and $c\leq b$, and for any $J$-covering sieve $\{a_{i}\to a\textrm{ | }i\in I\}$ in $\cal C$ if $a\in F$ then there exists $i\in I$ such that $a_{i}\in F$.
Definition 3.6. Let $({\cal C},J)$ be a site and $I$ be a $J$-ideal on $\cal C$. We say that $I$ is $J$-compact if for every covering $\{I_{k}\textrm{ | }k\in K\}$ of $I$ by subterminals in ${\bf Sh}({\cal C},J)$ there exists a $J$-covering sieve $\{f_{h}:c_{h}\to c\textrm{ | }h\in H\}$ in $\cal C$ such that for every $h\in H$, $(c_{h})\downarrow_{J}$ is contained in some $I_{k}$, and $\{(c_{h})\downarrow_{J}\textrm{ | }h\in H\}$ covers $I$ in ${\bf Sh}({\cal C},J)$.
Definition 8.3. With the notation above, given a function $\xi:A\to M$ and a set $R$ of (infinitary) Horn sequents of the form $\phi\vdash_{[]}\psi$ where $\phi$ and $\psi$ are closed infinitary Horn formulae over the signature $\Sigma_{\mathbb{A}}^{A}$, we say that $M$ is presented via $\xi$ by the set of generators $A$ subject to the relations $R$, briefly that $M$ is presented by $(A,R)$, if $M$, regarded as a $\Sigma_{\mathbb{A}}^{A}$-structure as specified above, is an initial object in the category ${\mathbb{T}}_{A,R}\textrm{-mod}({\bf Set})$ of ${\mathbb{T}}_{A,R}$-models in ${\bf Set}$ and homomorphisms between them.
Definition 10.14. [cf. Proposition 6.1] Let $\cal C$ be a preorder, $L$ be a frame and $f:{\cal C}\to L$ be a monotone map. We say that $f$ is filtering if the following conditions hold: (i) $1_{L}=\mathbin{\mathop{\textrm{\huge$\vee$}}\limits_{c\in{\cal C}}}f(c)$; (ii) For any $c,c^{\prime}\in{\cal C}$, $f(c)\wedge f(c^{\prime})=\mathbin{\mathop{\textrm{\huge$\vee$}}\limits_{b\in B% _{c,c^{\prime}}}}f(b)$ where $B_{c,c^{\prime}}$ is the set $\{b\in{\cal C}\textrm{ | }b\leq c\textrm{ and }b\leq c^{\prime}\}.$
Definition 3.21. Let $\cal K$ be a category of poset structures as in section 3.1, where each of the structures $\cal C$ in $\cal K$ is equipped with a Grothendieck topology $J_{\cal C}$, and let $P$ be an invariant property of embeddings $B_{L}\hookrightarrow L$ of a basis $B_{L}$ of a frame $L$ into $L$ which holds for all the canonical embeddings ${\cal C}\hookrightarrow Id_{J_{\cal C}}({\cal C})$, where $\cal C$ is a structure in $\cal K$. A topos-theoretic invariant property $C$ of families of subterminals in a locally small cocomplete topos is said to be $\cal K$-compatible relative to $P$ if for any frame $L$ with a basis $B_{L}$ of $C$-compact elements which, regarded as a poset with the induced order, belongs to $\cal K$, if the embedding $B_{L}\hookrightarrow L$ satisfies (i) property $P$; (ii) the property that every covering in $L$ of an element of $B_{L}$ is refined by a covering satisfying $C$ made of elements of $B_{L}$, and (iii) the property that the $J_{B_{L}}$-covering sieves are sent by the embedding $B_{L}\hookrightarrow L$ into covering families in $L$, where $J_{B_{L}}$ is the Grothendieck topology with which $B_{L}$ comes equipped as a structure in $\cal K$ then $J_{B_{L}}$ is equal to the induced Grothendieck topology $J_{can}^{L}|_{B_{L}}$ on $B_{L}$. An invariant $C$ is said to be $\cal K$-compatible if it is $\cal K$-compatible relative to $P$ for some invariant property $P$ as above.
Definition 2.2. Let $\cal E$ be a locally small cocomplete topos, $\Gamma$ be a subframe of ${\rm Sub}_{\cal E}(1)$ and $i:X\to\textsc{P}$ be an indexing function of a set P of points of $\cal E$ by a set $X$. The $\Gamma$-subterminal topology ${\tau}^{\cal E}_{\Gamma,i}$ on the set $X$ is the image of the function $\phi_{\Gamma,{\cal E}}:\Gamma\to{\mathscr{P}}(X)$ given by $\phi_{\Gamma,{\cal E}}(u)=\{x\in X\textrm{ | }\xi(x)^{\ast}(u)\cong 1_{{\bf Set% }}\}.$ In other words, the subsets in ${\tau}^{\cal E}_{\Gamma,i}$ are precisely those of the form $\phi_{\Gamma,{\cal E}}(u)$ where $u$ ranges among the subterminals in $\Gamma$.
Definition 3.11. Let $\cal E$ be a locally small cocomplete topos and $\cal F$ be a family of subobjects of a given object in $\cal E$. (a) The family $\cal F$ is said to have a finite subcover if there exists a finite subfamily ${\cal F}^{\prime}$ of $\cal F$ such that the union of the subobjects in ${\cal F}^{\prime}$ is equal to the union of the subobjects in $\cal F$; (b) The family $\cal F$ is said to have a singleton subcover if there exists a single subobject in $\cal F$ which is the union of the subobjects in the family ${\cal F}$; (c) Given a regular cardinal $k$, the family $\cal F$ is said to have a $k$-subcover if there exists a subfamily ${\cal F}^{\prime}$ of $\cal F$ of cardinality $<k$ such that the union of the subobjects in ${\cal F}^{\prime}$ is equal to the union of the subobjects in $\cal F$; (d) The family $\cal F$ is said to have a disjunctive refinement (resp. to have a finite disjunctive refinement) if there exists a family (resp. a finite family) of pairwise disjoint subobjects which refines $\cal F$; (e) The family $\cal F$ is said to have an atomic refinement (resp. to have a finite atomic refinement if either $\cal F$ is a singleton or there exists a family (resp. a finite family) of atomic subobjects which refines $\cal F$; (f) The family $\cal F$ is said to have a supercompact refinement (resp. to have a finite supercompact refinement if either $\cal F$ is a singleton or there exists a family (resp. a finite family) of supercompact subobjects which refines $\cal F$; (g) The family $\cal F$ is said to have a directed refinement if there exists a directed family $\cal G$ (i.e. a non-empty family such that for any two subobjects in $\cal G$ there exists a subobject in $\cal G$ which contains both) which refines $\cal F$.
Definition 10.1. Let $({\cal C},\leq)$ be a preorder. (i) A coverage on $\cal C$ is a function $J$ which assigns to every element $c\in{\cal C}$ a family $J(c)$ of subsets of $(c)\downarrow$ such that for any $S\in J(c)$ and any $c^{\prime}\leq c$ the subset $S_{c^{\prime}}=\{d\leq c^{\prime}\textrm{ | }d\in S\}$ belongs to $J(c^{\prime})$; (ii) A coverage on $\cal C$ is said to be a Grothendieck coverage if for any $c\in{\cal C}$, $(c)\downarrow\in J(c)$ and for any subset $S\subseteq(c)\downarrow$, if $S_{c^{\prime}}\in J(c^{\prime})$ for every $c^{\prime}\in T$ where $T\in J(c)$ then $S\in J(c)$; (iii) A site is a pair $({\cal C},J)$, where $\cal C$ is a preorder and $J$ is a coverage on $\cal C$; (iv) A coverage $J$ on $\cal C$ is subcanonical if for every $c\in{\cal C}$ and any subset $S\in J(c)$, $c$ is the supremum in $\cal C$ of the elements $d\in S$ (i.e., for any element $c^{\prime}$ in $\cal C$ such that for every $d\in S$ $d\leq c^{\prime}$, we have $c\leq c^{\prime}$).
Definition 3.3. Let $F:{\cal C}\to{\cal D}$ be a functor which creates isomorphisms. The extended image $ExtIm(F)$ of $F$ is the subcategory of $\cal D$ having as objects the objects of $\cal D$ which are isomorphic to an object of the form $F(c)$, and as arrows the arrows $f:x\to y$ in $\cal D$ such that there exist objects $c,c^{\prime}\in{\cal C}$, an arrow $u:c\to c^{\prime}$ in $\cal C$ and isomorphisms $x\cong F(c)$ and $y\cong F(c^{\prime})$ such that $F(u)$ is the factorization of $f$ through these isomorphisms.
Definition 3.22. Let $\cal K$ be a category of poset structures as in section 3.1, where each of the structures $\cal C$ in $\cal K$ is equipped with a Grothendieck topology $J_{\cal C}$, let $P$ be an invariant property of embeddings $B_{L}\hookrightarrow L$ of a basis $B_{L}$ of a frame $L$ into $L$ which holds for all the canonical embeddings ${\cal C}\hookrightarrow Id_{J_{\cal C}}({\cal C})$ (where $\cal C$ is a structure in $\cal K$), and $C$ be a topos-theoretic invariant property of families of subterminals in a locally small cocomplete topos. Given a structure $\cal C$ in $\cal K$, the Grothendieck topology $J_{\cal C}$ is said to be $C$-induced relative to $P$ if for any $J_{can}^{L}$-dense monotone embedding $i:{\cal C}\hookrightarrow L$ into a frame $L$ which satisfies property $P$ and such that the $J_{\cal C}$-covering sieves on $\cal C$ are sent by $i$ to covering families in $L$, for any family $\cal A$ of objects in $\cal C$ there exists a $J_{\cal C}$-covering sieve on an object $c\in{\cal C}$ such that the arrows $a\rightarrowtail c$ for $a\in{\cal A}$ generate $S$ if and only if the image $i(\cal A)$ of the family $\cal A$ in $L$ has a refinement satisfying $C$ made of objects of the form $i(c^{\prime})$ (for $c^{\prime}\in{\cal C}$). The Grothendieck topology $J_{\cal C}$ is said to be $C$-induced if it is $C$-induced relative to $P$ for some invariant property $P$ as above.
Definition 10.3. Let $({\cal C},\leq)$ be a preorder and $J$ be a coverage on $\cal C$. 1. An ideal on $\cal C$ is a subset $I\subseteq{\cal C}$ such that for any $a,b\in{\cal C}$ such that $b\leq a$ in $\cal C$, $a\in I$ implies $b\in I$. A $J$-ideal on $\cal C$ is an ideal on $\cal C$ such that for any $R\in J(c)$, if $a\in I$ for every $a\in R$ then $c\in I$. 2. Given a subset $I$ on $\cal C$, the $J$-closure $\overline{I}^{J}$ is the smallest $J$-ideal on $\cal C$ containing $I$, equivalently the intersection of all the $J$-ideals which contain $I$. 3. Given an object $c$ of $\cal C$, we define the principal $J$-ideal $(c)\downarrow_{J}$ generated by $c$ as the $J$-closure of the subset $(c)\downarrow$ of $\cal C$.

The space of points of $X$ is the set $X_{p}$ of all the points of $X$ equipped with the topology given by the image of the frame homomorphism $\phi_{X}:{\cal O}(X)\to{\mathscr{P}}(X_{p})$ defined by: $\phi_{X}(U)=\{p\in X_{p}\textrm{ | }p^{\ast}(U)=1\},$ for any $U\in{\cal O}(X)$.
Definition 3.8. (a) We say that a family of subobjects $\{a_{i}\rightarrowtail a\textrm{ |}i\in I\}$ of a given object $a$ in a (locally small cocomplete) topos $\cal E$ is refined by a family $\{b_{j}\rightarrowtail a\textrm{ | }j\in J\}$ of subobjects of $a$ if for every $j\in J$ there exists $i\in I$ such that $b_{j}\rightarrowtail a$ factors through $a_{i}\rightarrowtail a$ and the union $\mathbin{\mathop{\textrm{\huge$\vee$}}\limits_{i\in I}}a_{i}$ in ${\rm Sub}_{\cal E}(a)$ is equal to the union $\mathbin{\mathop{\textrm{\huge$\vee$}}\limits_{j\in J}}b_{j}$ in ${\rm Sub}_{\cal E}(a)$.

Definition 8.1. (a) An infinitary Horn formula over a first-order signature $\Sigma$ is a formula built from atomic formulae by only using possibly infinitary conjunctions (including the conjunction over the empty set, which we identify with the truth formula $\top$); (b) An infinitary Horn theory over a signature $\Sigma$ is an infinitary first-order theory over $\Sigma$ whose axioms are infinitary Horn sequents, that is sequents of the form $\phi\vdash_{\vec{x}}\psi$ where $\phi$ and $\psi$ are infinitary Horn formulae in the same context $\vec{x}$; (c) By infinitary Horn logic we mean the logic of infinitary Horn theories, i.e. the fragment of infinitary first-order logic in which only the structural rules and the rules for infinitary conjunctions are present; (d) An ordered algebraic theory is an infinitary Horn theory over a one-sorted signature $\Sigma$ consisting of a set of (possibly infinitary) function symbols and a binary relation symbol $\leq$, in which the following three Horn sequents, expressing the idea that $\leq$ is a partial order, are provable (in Horn logic): $(\top\vdash_{x}x\leq x),$ $(x\leq y\vdash_{x,y}y\leq x),$ $((x\leq y)\wedge(y\leq z)\vdash_{x,y,z}x\leq z).$ (e) Following [18], we say that an ordered algebraic theory $\mathbb{T}$ over a signature $\Sigma$ is small if for every cardinal number $k$, there is only a set of $k$-ary terms over $\Sigma$ up to $\mathbb{T}$-provable equivalence.
Definition 3.19. Let $\cal K$ be a category of structures as in section 3.1, where each of the structures $\cal C$ in $\cal K$ is equipped with a Grothendieck topology $J_{\cal C}$, and let $C$ be an invariant property of families of subterminals in a topos. The invariant $C$ is said to be $\cal K$-adequate is it is $({\cal C},J_{\cal C})$-adequate for every structure $\cal C$ in $\cal K$.
Definition 10.10. Let $\cal C$ be a preorder and $J$ be a coverage on $\cal C$. We say that $J$ is subcanonical if for every $c\in{\cal C}$ and any $S\in J(c)$, for any $c^{\prime}\in{\cal C}$, if $d\leq c^{\prime}$ for every $d\in S$ then $c\leq c^{\prime}$).
Definition 3.1. $\operatorname{\mathsf{Quilt}}(n)$ is the set of $(W,T)\in\operatorname{\mathsf{F_{2}S}}(n)\times\operatorname{\mathsf{Tree}}(n)$ such that (1) $W=\dots u\dots v\dots\implies u\ngtr_{T}v$ (2) $W=\dots u\dots v\dots u\dots\implies v\trianglelefteq_{T}u$. A quilt is an element of $\operatorname{\mathsf{Quilt}}:=\bigcup_{n\geq 1}\operatorname{\mathsf{Quilt}}(% n),$ and $\operatorname{\textit{Quilt}}\subset\operatorname{\textit{F}_{2}\textit{S}}% \mathbin{\underset{\scriptscriptstyle\mathrm{H}}{\otimes}}\operatorname{% \textit{Brace}}$ is the abelian subgroup generated by $\operatorname{\mathsf{Quilt}}$. Denote $Q=(\mathcal{W}_{Q},\mathcal{T}_{Q})\in\operatorname{\mathsf{Quilt}}$. Any definition or notation for $\operatorname{\mathsf{Tree}}$ and $\operatorname{\mathsf{F_{2}S}}$ extends to $\operatorname{\mathsf{Quilt}}$, e.g., $\leq_{Q}$ means $\leq_{\mathcal{T}_{Q}}$.
Definition 2.5. $\operatorname{\mathsf{Tree}}(n)$ is the set of trees with vertex set $\langle n\rangle$, and $\operatorname{\mathsf{Tree}}:=\bigcup_{n\geq 1}\operatorname{\mathsf{Tree}}(n).$ For $T\in\operatorname{\mathsf{Tree}}(n)$, the arity is $\#T:=n$, so $\mathcal{V}_{T}=\langle\#T\rangle$. For $T\in\operatorname{\mathsf{Tree}}(n)$ and a permutation $\sigma\in\mathbb{S}_{n}$, $T^{\sigma}\in\operatorname{\mathsf{Tree}}(n)$ is defined by replacing any $u\in\langle n\rangle$ with $\sigma^{-1}(u)$. $\operatorname{\textit{Brace}}$ is the $\mathbb{S}$-module generated as a free abelian group by $\operatorname{\mathsf{Tree}}$.
Definition 2.10. Let $\operatorname{\mathsf{F_{2}S}}=\bigcup_{n\geq 1}\operatorname{\mathsf{F_{2}S}}% (n).$ The arity of $W\in\operatorname{\mathsf{F_{2}S}}(n)$ is $\#W:=n$. The degree of $W\in\operatorname{\mathsf{F_{2}S}}(n)$ is $\deg W:=\lvert W\rvert-n$. For $W\in\operatorname{\mathsf{F_{2}S}}(n)$ and $\sigma\in\mathbb{S}_{n}$, $W^{\sigma}\in\operatorname{\mathsf{F_{2}S}}(n)$ is defined by replacing any $u\in\langle n\rangle$ by $\sigma^{-1}(u)$, i.e., $\pi_{W^{\sigma}}=\sigma^{-1}\circ\pi_{W}$. $\operatorname{\textit{F}_{2}\textit{S}}$ is the graded $\mathbb{S}$-module generated as a free graded abelian group by $\operatorname{\mathsf{F_{2}S}}$ with grading $\deg$.
Definition 4.5. Let $\operatorname{\textit{NS Op}}$ be the $\mathbb{N}$-colored operad of sets whose algebras are nonsymmetric operads [4, §1.5.3]. (See also [3, §1.5.6] for the symmetric version.) Explicitly, given $n\in\mathbb{N}$, $\mathbf{q}=(q_{1},\dots,q_{n})\in\mathbb{N}^{n}$, and $q^{\prime}=1+\sum_{a=1}^{n}(q_{a}-1)$ define $\operatorname{\textit{NS Op}}(n;\mathbf{q},q^{\prime})$ to be the set of pairs $(\mathcal{T}_{I},I)$ where $\mathcal{T}_{I}\in\operatorname{\mathsf{Tree}}(n)$ and $I:\mathcal{E}_{I}\to\mathbb{N}$ such that: • for $(u,v)\in\mathcal{E}_{I}$, $1\leq I_{(u,v)}\leq q_{u}$; • $(t,u),(t,v)\in\mathcal{E}_{I}$, $u\vartriangleleft_{I}v\implies I_{(t,u)}<I_{(t,v)}$. An element $(\mathcal{T}_{I},I)\in\operatorname{\textit{NS Op}}(n;\mathbf{q},q^{\prime})$ describes a way of composing elements $f_{1},\dots,f_{n}$ in an arbitrary nonsymmetric operad, where $\#f_{a}=q_{a}$, and an edge $(u,v)\in\mathcal{E}_{I}$ means the composition $f_{u}\circ_{I_{(u,v)}}f_{v}$.
Definition 5.1. In any graded operad, let $\operatorname{ad}$ denote the adjoint action. That is, if $\#A=\deg A=1$, then $\operatorname{ad}_{A}B:=A\circ_{1}B-(-1)^{\deg B}\sum_{a\in\langle\#B\rangle}B% \circ_{a}A.$
Definition 2.2. The extension of $\langle m\rangle$ by $\langle n\rangle$ at $a\in\langle m\rangle$ in $\boldsymbol{\Delta}\!^{\prime}$ is $\langle n\rangle\stackrel{{\scriptstyle\alpha}}{{\hookrightarrow}}\langle n+m-% 1\rangle\stackrel{{\scriptstyle\beta}}{{\to\mskip-14.0mu \to}}\langle m\rangle.$ where $\alpha(j):=j+a-1$, and $\beta(k)=\begin{cases}k&k<a\\ a&a\leq k<a+n\\ k+1-n&k\geq a+n.\end{cases}$
Definition 2.8. Given a set $A$ (the alphabet), a word $W$ over $A$ is a finite, totally ordered set over $A$; that is, $W$ is equipped with a function $\pi_{W}:W\to A$. The length of $W$ is the cardinality $\lvert W\rvert$. I will denote elements of $W$ with an underscore such that $\pi_{W}(\underline{a})=a$, and call $\underline{a}$ an occurrence of $a\in A$. A letter is an element of $W$, or equivalently an element of $A$ if $\pi_{W}$ is a bijection. $W$ will be written as the sequence of values of $\pi_{W}$ (not separated by commas). The concatenation of words $W$ and $V$ is the disjoint union with $W$ before $V$, denoted $W\smile V$.
Definition 2.17. Again, let $\langle n\rangle\stackrel{{\scriptstyle\alpha}}{{\hookrightarrow}}\langle n+m-% 1\rangle\stackrel{{\scriptstyle\beta}}{{\to\mskip-14.0mu \to}}\langle m\rangle$ be the $\boldsymbol{\Delta}\!^{\prime}$-extension at $a\in\langle m\rangle$ from Definition 2.2. Given $V\in\operatorname{\mathsf{F_{2}S}}(m)$ and $W\in\operatorname{\mathsf{F_{2}S}}(n)$, an extension of $V$ by $W$ at $a$ is a word $X\in\operatorname{\mathsf{F_{2}S}}(n+m-1)$ such that: • deleting from $X$ the vertices not in the image of $\alpha$ and eliminating consecutive repetitions ($uu\mapsto u$) gives the same word as $W$ relabelled by $\alpha$; • these repetitions occur wherever letters have been deleted; • relabelling $X$ by $\beta$ and eliminating consecutive repetitions gives $V$. $\operatorname{Ext}(V,W,a)$ denotes the set of extensions of $V$ by $W$ at $a$.
Definition 4.10. $\delta^{\mathrm{S}}_{i}:=\mathcal{L}[\varepsilon_{i},\mbox{\small$1$}]:C^{p,q}% (\mathcal{A},\mathcal{A})\to C^{p+1,q}(\mathcal{A},\mathcal{A})$ and $\delta^{\mathrm{S}}:=\sum_{i=0}^{p+1}(-1)^{i}\delta^{\mathrm{S}}_{i}.$
Definition 6.10. The suspended Gerstenhaber operad, $\mathcal{S}\textit{Gerst}$ [18] is the graded operad generated by $m,\ell\in\mathcal{S}\textit{Gerst}(2)$ with $\deg m=1$, $\deg\ell=0$, and the relations $\displaystyle 0$ $\displaystyle=m+m^{(12)}=\ell+\ell^{(12)}$ $\displaystyle 0$ $\displaystyle=m\circ_{1}m+m\circ_{2}m$ $\displaystyle 0$ $\displaystyle=\ell\circ_{1}\ell+(\ell\circ_{1}\ell)^{(123)}+(\ell\circ_{1}\ell% )^{(321)}$ $\displaystyle 0$ $\displaystyle=\ell\circ_{1}m-(m\circ_{1}\ell)^{(23)}-m\circ_{2}\ell.$
Definition 2.6. Let $\langle n\rangle\stackrel{{\scriptstyle\alpha}}{{\hookrightarrow}}\langle n+m-% 1\rangle\stackrel{{\scriptstyle\beta}}{{\to\mskip-14.0mu \to}}\langle m\rangle$ be the $\boldsymbol{\Delta}\!^{\prime}$-extension at $a\in\langle m\rangle$ as in Definition 2.2. Given $S\in\operatorname{\mathsf{Tree}}(m)$ and $T\in\operatorname{\mathsf{Tree}}(n)$, an extension of $S$ by $T$ at $a$ is a tree $U\in\operatorname{\mathsf{Tree}}(n+m-1)$ such that: • $T$, relabelled by $\alpha$, is a subtree of $U$ in the sense that $(r,s)\in\mathcal{E}_{T}\iff(\alpha t,\alpha s)\in\mathcal{E}_{U}$ and $r\vartriangleleft_{T}t\iff\alpha r\vartriangleleft_{U}\alpha t;$ • $S$ is the quotient of $U$ by the image of $T$, relabelled by $\beta$ in the sense that $(u,w)\in\mathcal{E}_{U}\implies(\beta u,\beta w)\in\mathcal{E}_{S}\text{ or }% \beta u=\beta w=a$ and $\beta u\vartriangleleft_{U}\beta w\implies u\vartriangleleft_{T}w.$ Denote the set of such extensions as $\operatorname{Ext}(S,T,a)$.
Definition 2.11. For $W\in\operatorname{\mathsf{F_{2}S}}(n)$, the $\downarrow$ ordering of $\langle n\rangle$ is the (total) order of first occurrence in $W$.
Definition 4.1. The semisimplex category $\operatorname{\boldsymbol{\Delta}_{+}}$ has objects $[p]$ for all $p\in\mathbb{N}$ and morphisms are strictly increasing (increasing and injective) functions.
Definition 5.5. Let $\mathcal{A}:\mathsf{C}\to\mathsf{Alg}_{\Bbbk}$ be a diagram of algebras. Define $\hat{\mathsf{m}}\in C^{0,2}(\mathcal{A},\mathcal{A})$ by $\hat{\mathsf{m}}(x;a,b):=ab$ for all $x\in\operatorname{Obj}\mathsf{C}$ and $a,b\in\mathcal{A}(x)$, i.e., multiplication in $\mathcal{A}(x)$ expressed as a cochain. Define $\delta^{\mathrm{H}}:C^{\bullet,\bullet}(\mathcal{A},\mathcal{A})\to C^{\bullet% ,\bullet}(\mathcal{A},\mathcal{A})$ by $\delta^{\mathrm{H}}f:=\mathcal{R}_{0}\left(\mathord{\raisebox{0.0pt}[0.0pt][0.% 0pt]{$\,\begin{array}[]{|c|}\hline\makebox[5.0pt]{$1$}\\ \hline\makebox[5.0pt]{$2$}\\ \hline\end{array}\,$}}-\mathord{\raisebox{0.0pt}[0.0pt][0.0pt]{$\,\begin{array% }[]{|c|}\hline\makebox[5.0pt]{$2$}\\ \hline\makebox[5.0pt]{$1$}\\ \hline\end{array}\,$}}\right)(\hat{\mathsf{m}},f)$ for all $f\in C^{\bullet,\bullet}(\mathcal{A},\mathcal{A})$. The Hochschild complex of $\mathcal{A}$ is $\operatorname{tot}C^{\bullet,\bullet}(\mathcal{A},\mathcal{A})$ with coboundary $\delta:=\delta^{\mathrm{S}}+\delta^{\mathrm{H}}$.
Definition 2.18. Suppose that $X\in\operatorname{Ext}(V,W,a)$. Let $\langle\#W\rangle\stackrel{{\scriptstyle\alpha}}{{\hookrightarrow}}\langle\#X% \rangle\stackrel{{\scriptstyle\beta}}{{\to\mskip-14.0mu \to}}\langle\#V\rangle$ be the $\boldsymbol{\Delta}\!^{\prime}$-extension at $a$. Identify interposed vertices of $V$ and $W$ with those of $X$ as follows: • If $w\in\langle\#W\rangle$ is interposed in $W$, then identify this with $\alpha w\in\langle\#X\rangle$. • If $v\in\langle\#V\rangle$ is interposed in $V$ and $v\neq a$, then identify $v$ with $\beta^{-1}v\in\langle\#X\rangle$. • If $a$ is interposed in $V$, and $w$ is the first letter of $W$, then identify $a$ with $\alpha w$. Define $\operatorname{sgn}_{V,W,v}(X)$ as the sign of the $(\deg V,\deg W)$-shuffle from • the interposed vertices of $V$ in $\downarrow$ order, identified with vertices of $X$, then the interposed vertices of $W$, identified with vertices of $X$ • to the interposed vertices of $X$ in $\downarrow$ order. This defines $\operatorname{sgn}_{V,W,a}:\operatorname{Ext}(V,W,a)\to\{1,-1\}.$
Definition 4.12. For $T\in\operatorname{\mathsf{Tree}}(n)$ and $\mathbf{q}\in\mathbb{N}^{n}$, let $\operatorname{Clr}(T;\mathbf{q})=\{I\in\operatorname{\textit{NS Op}}(n;\mathbf% {q},q^{\prime})\mid\mathcal{T}_{I}=T\},$ where $q^{\prime}=1+\sum_{a=1}^{n}(q_{a}-1)$. An element of this set is a coloring of $T$.
Definition 7.1. $\textit{L}_{\infty}$ is the dg-operad generated by the elements $\ell_{n}\in\textit{L}_{\infty}(n)$ for $n=2,3,\dots$ satisfying $\deg\ell_{n}=n-2$, $(\ell_{n})^{\sigma}=\operatorname{sgn}(\sigma)\,\ell_{n}$ for all $\sigma\in\mathbb{S}_{n}$, and $0=\partial\ell_{n}+\sum_{\begin{subarray}{c}p,q\geq 2\\ p+q=n+1\end{subarray}}\sum_{\sigma\in\operatorname{Sh}_{p-1,q}}(-1)^{(p-1)q}% \operatorname{sgn}\sigma\,\left(\ell_{p}\circ_{p}\ell_{q}\right)^{\sigma^{-1}},$ where $\operatorname{Sh}_{p-1,q}\subset\mathbb{S}_{n}$ is the set of $(p-1,q)$-shuffles.
Definition 4.21. If it is not already defined, then $\operatorname{sgn}_{Q}(\boldsymbol{\zeta},I)$ is defined by replacing $q_{a}=0$ with $2$ or by $\operatorname{sgn}_{Q}(\boldsymbol{\zeta},I):=\operatorname{sgn}_{Q}(E_{Q,a}E_% {Q,a}\boldsymbol{\zeta},I).$
Definition 7.16. Denote $\operatorname{MC}(f):=\delta f+\widehat{P_{2}}(f,f)+\widehat{P_{3}}(f,f,f)+% \widehat{P_{4}}(f,f,f,f)$ and $\operatorname{MC}^{0}(f):=\delta^{\mathrm{S}}f+\widehat{P_{2}^{0}}(f,f)+% \widehat{P_{3}^{0}}(f,f,f)+\widehat{P_{4}^{0}}(f,f,f,f).$ Write $\operatorname{MC}_{(p,q)}$ for the component in $C^{p,q}(\mathcal{A},\mathcal{A})$ (with $p+q=3$).
Definition 5.9. Let $Q\in\operatorname{\mathsf{Quilt}}(n)$. Given $u\in\langle n\rangle$, define $\mathcal{T}_{Q^{(1)}_{u}}$ by attaching $n+1$ as the parent of $u$ in $\mathcal{T}_{Q}$. If $u$ already had a parent, then that becomes the parent of $n+1$. Define $\mathcal{W}_{Q^{(1)}_{u}}$ by inserting $n+1$ before the first $u$ in $\mathcal{W}_{Q}$. See Figure 2. Given a corner $\underline{u}\in\mathcal{C}_{Q}$, define $\mathcal{T}_{Q^{(2)}_{\underline{u}}}$ by attaching $n+1$ to $u$ at $\underline{u}$. Define $\mathcal{W}_{Q^{(2)}_{\underline{u}}}$ by inserting $n+1$ after the last $u$ in $\mathcal{W}_{Q}$. See Figure 2. Given $u\in\langle n\rangle$, let $v$ be is its $\vartriangleleft_{Q}$-first child. Define $\mathcal{T}_{Q^{(3)}_{u}}$ by removing the edge $(u,v)$ and attaching $n+1$ as the parent of $v$ and $u$. If $u$ already has a parent, then that becomes the parent of $n+1$. Define $\mathcal{W}_{Q^{(3)}_{u}}$ by inserting $n+1$ before the first $u$. See Figure 4. Given $u\in\langle n\rangle$, let $w$ be is its $\vartriangleleft_{Q}$-last child. Define $\mathcal{T}_{Q^{(4)}_{u}}$ by removing the edge $(u,w)$ and attaching $n+1$ as the parent of of $u$ and $w$. If $u$ already has a parent, then that becomes the parent of $n+1$. Define $\mathcal{W}_{Q^{(3)}_{u}}$ by inserting $n+1$ before the first $u$. See Figure 4. Given $u\in\langle n\rangle$ and $\vartriangleleft_{Q}$-consecutive children $v,w\in\langle n\rangle$, define $\mathcal{T}_{Q^{(5)}_{u,v,w}}$ by attaching $n+1$ as a child of $u$ and the parent of $v$ and $w$. Define $\mathcal{W}_{Q^{(5)}_{u.v,w}}$ by inserting $n+1$ after the last $u$. See Figure 5.
Definition 4.3. A homogeneous element $f\in C^{p,q}(\mathcal{A},\mathcal{A})$ has bidegree $(p,q)$. The total space $\operatorname{tot}C^{\bullet,\bullet}(\mathcal{A},\mathcal{A})$ is graded by the total degree $p+q$. The suspension $\mathsf{s}_{2}C^{\bullet,\bullet}(\mathcal{A},\mathcal{A})$ is graded by the shifted bidegree $\lVert f\rVert:=(p,q-1)$. The total suspension $\mathsf{s}\operatorname{tot}C^{\bullet,\bullet}(\mathcal{A},\mathcal{A})$ is graded by the shifted total degree $\lvert f\rvert:=p+q-1$.
Definition 5.3. For $Q\in\operatorname{\mathsf{Quilt}}$, the element $Q\circ(\operatorname{id},\dots,\operatorname{id},\underbrace{\mathsf{m},\dots,% \mathsf{m}}_{n\text{ times}})\in\textit{mQuilt}$ where the last $n$ vertices occur in $\downarrow$ order will be denoted by a diagram with the last $n$ vertices labelled by $\mathsf{m}$.
Definition 3.4. $\operatorname{Ext}(P,Q,a):=\operatorname{Ext}(\mathcal{W}_{P},\mathcal{W}_{Q},% a)\times\operatorname{Ext}(\mathcal{T}_{P},\mathcal{T}_{Q},a)$ and $\operatorname{sgn}_{P,Q,a}:=\operatorname{sgn}_{\mathcal{W}_{P},\mathcal{W}_{Q% },a}$.
Definition 7.9. $P^{0}_{n}$ is $(-1)^{1+n(n-1)/2}$ times the sum of all quilts $Q\in\operatorname{\mathsf{Quilt}}(n)$ with $\deg Q=n-2$ that are labelled in $\downarrow$ order.
Definition 4.18. Define the word $\mathfrak{I}_{a}(p_{a},q_{a}):=0_{\mathrm{v}a}\dots(p_{a}-1)_{\mathrm{v}a}1_{% \mathrm{h}a}\dots(q_{a}-1)_{\mathrm{h}a}$ for each $a\in\langle\#Q\rangle$, and concatenate these in labelled order: $\mathfrak{I}(\mathbf{p},\mathbf{q}):=\mathfrak{I}_{1}(p_{1},q_{1})\smile% \mathfrak{I}_{1}(p_{2},q_{2})\smile\dots\smile\mathfrak{I}_{\#Q}(p_{\#Q},q_{\#% Q}).$
Definition 6.6. $C_{3}:=\mathord{\raisebox{0.0pt}[0.0pt][0.0pt]{$\,\begin{array}[]{|c|c|}\hline% \omit\span\omit\mathsf{m}\\ \hline\makebox[5.0pt]{$1$}&\makebox[5.0pt]{${\color[rgb]{.8,.8,.8}\definecolor% [named]{pgfstrokecolor}{rgb}{.8,.8,.8}\pgfsys@color@gray@stroke{.8}% \pgfsys@color@gray@fill{.8}\makebox[5.0pt]{\rule[-4.0pt]{11.25pt}{12.5pt}}}$}% \\ \hline\makebox[5.0pt]{$3$}&\makebox[5.0pt]{$2$}\\ \hline\end{array}\,$}}$
Definition 4.7. Let $(\boldsymbol{\zeta},I)\in\operatorname{\textit{ColorQuilt}}(n;\mathbf{p},% \mathbf{q},p^{\prime},q^{\prime})$, $f_{a}\in C^{p_{a},q_{a}}(\mathcal{A},\mathcal{A})$ for all $a\in\langle n\rangle$, and $\boldsymbol{\phi}=(\phi_{1},\dots,\phi_{p^{\prime}})$ with $\phi_{k}:x_{k}\to x_{k-1}$ in $\mathsf{C}$. First note that $f_{a}[\zeta_{a}^{*}\boldsymbol{\phi}]:\mathcal{A}(x_{\zeta_{a}(p_{a})})^{% \otimes q_{a}}\to\mathcal{A}(x_{\zeta_{a}(0)}).$ Now, compose all of these, using the functor $\mathcal{A}$ to connect different vector spaces. • If $u$ is the root of $\mathcal{T}_{I}$, then compose $\mathcal{A}[\phi_{0,\zeta_{u}(0)}]\circ f_{u}[\zeta_{u}^{*}\boldsymbol{\phi}]$. • If $(a,b)\in\mathcal{E}_{I}$, then compose $f_{a}[\zeta_{a}^{*}\boldsymbol{\phi}]\circ_{I_{(a,b)}}\mathcal{A}[\phi_{\zeta_% {a}(p_{a}),\zeta_{b}(0)}]\circ f_{b}[\zeta_{b}^{*}\boldsymbol{\phi}]$. • For $a\in\langle n\rangle$ and $1\leq j\leq q_{a}$, if there does not exist $(a,b)\in\mathcal{E}_{I}$ with $I_{(a,b)}=j$, then compose $f_{a}[\zeta_{a}^{*}\boldsymbol{\phi}]\circ_{j}\mathcal{A}[\phi_{\zeta_{a}(p_{a% }),p^{\prime}}]$. All of these compositions together define $\mathcal{L}(\boldsymbol{\zeta},I;f_{1},\dots,f_{n})[\boldsymbol{\phi}]:% \mathcal{A}(x_{p^{\prime}})^{\otimes q^{\prime}}\to\mathcal{A}(x_{0}),$ and hence $\mathcal{L}(\boldsymbol{\zeta},I;f_{1},\dots,f_{n})\in C^{p^{\prime},q^{\prime% }}(\mathcal{A},\mathcal{A}).$ This is multilinear by construction, so $\mathcal{L}[\boldsymbol{\zeta},I]:C^{p_{1},q_{1}}(\mathcal{A},\mathcal{A})% \otimes\dots\otimes C^{p_{n},q_{n}}(\mathcal{A},\mathcal{A})\to C^{p^{\prime},% q^{\prime}}(\mathcal{A},\mathcal{A}).\ $
Definition 2.15. Given $W\in\operatorname{\mathsf{F_{2}S}}$, define $\operatorname{sgn}_{W}:W\to\{1,-1\}$ as follows. Number the caesurae in $W$ consecutively, starting from $1$. If $\underline{a}\in W$ is the $k$’th caesura, then $\operatorname{sgn}_{W}\underline{a}=(-1)^{k}$. If $\underline{a}$ is the last occurrence of $a$, but the previous occurrence of $a$ is the $k$’th caesura, then $\operatorname{sgn}_{W}\underline{a}=(-1)^{k+1}$.
Definition 2.1. For any $n\in\mathbb{N}$, let $\langle n\rangle:=\{1,2,\dots,n\}$. Let $\boldsymbol{\Delta}\!^{\prime}$ be the category whose set of objects is $\{\langle n\rangle\mid n\geq 1\}$ and whose morphisms are weakly increasing maps.
