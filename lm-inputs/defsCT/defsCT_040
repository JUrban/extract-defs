Definition 2.6. A $2$-computad consists of a $1$-computad $G$ and a set $G_{2}$ together with functions $dom:G_{2}\rightarrow diags(G)$ (resp. $cod:G_{2}\rightarrow diags(G)$) such that $dom(dom)=dom(cod)$ and $cod(dom)=cod(cod)$ as functions from $G_{2}$ to $G_{0}$. A $2$-computad morphism from $(G,G_{2},dom,cod)$ to $(H,H_{2},dom,cod)$ consists of a $1$-computad morphism $f:G\rightarrow H$ and a function $f_{2}:G_{2}\rightarrow H_{2}$ such that $dom(f_{2})=f(dom)$ and $cod(f_{2})=f(cod)$.
Definition 3.7. Two deformations $(\hat{\cal C},\hat{\cal D},\hat{F})$ and $(\tilde{\cal C},\tilde{\cal D},\tilde{F})$ are strongly equivalent if $\hat{\cal C}=\tilde{\cal C}$, $\hat{\cal D}=\tilde{\cal D}$, and there exists a natural isomorphism $\phi:\hat{F}\Rightarrow\tilde{F}$ which reduces to $Id_{F}$ modulo ${m}$. Two deformations $(\hat{\cal C},\hat{\cal D},\hat{F})$ and $(\tilde{\cal C},\tilde{\cal D},\tilde{F})$ are weakly equivalent if there exist equivalences of deformations of categories, $\Gamma:\hat{\cal C}\rightarrow\tilde{\cal C}$ and $\Delta:\hat{\cal D}\rightarrow\tilde{\cal D}$, and a natural isomorphism $\phi:\hat{F}\Delta\Rightarrow\Gamma\tilde{F}$, which reduces modulo ${m}$ to $Id_{F}$.
Definition 4.1. The Hochschild complex of a parallel pair of functors, $F,G:{\cal A}\rightarrow{\cal B}$ has cochain groups given by $C^{n}(F,G):=\prod_{x_{0},\ldots,x_{n}\in Ob({\cal A})}{\rm Hom}_{k}({\cal A}(x% _{0},x_{1})\otimes\ldots\otimes{\cal A}(x_{n-1},x_{n}),{\cal B}(F(x_{0}),G(x_{% n}))),$ and for $n=0$, noting that $k$ is the empty tensor product, $C^{0}(F,G):=\prod_{x_{0}\in Ob({\cal A})}{\rm Hom}_{k}(k,{\cal B}(F(x_{0}),G(x% _{0})))$ with coboundary given by $\displaystyle\delta\psi(f_{0}\otimes\ldots\otimes f_{n}):=$ $\displaystyle F(f_{0})\phi(f_{1}\otimes\ldots\otimes f_{n})+$ $\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{n}(-1)^{i}\phi(f_{0}\otimes\ldots\otimes f_{i-1}f_{i}% \otimes\ldots\otimes f_{n})+$ $\displaystyle(-1)^{n+1}\phi(f_{0}\otimes\ldots\otimes f_{n-1})G(f_{n})$
Definition 2.11. A $3$-computad consists of a $2$-computad $G$ and as set $G_{3}$ together with functions $dom:G_{3}\rightarrow diags(G)$ (resp. $cod:G_{3}\rightarrow diags(G)$) such that $dom(dom)=dom(cod)$ and $cod(dom)=cod(cod)$ as functions from $G_{3}$ to $diags(G_{1},G_{0},cod,dom)$. A $3$-computad morphism from $(G,G_{3},dom,cod)$ to $(H,H_{3},dom,cod)$ consists of a $2$-computad morphism $f:G\rightarrow H$ and a function $f_{3}:G_{2}\rightarrow H_{2}$ such that $dom(f_{3})=f(dom)$ and $cod(f_{3})=f(cod)$.
Definition 2.4. The $1$-pasting composition of a labelling of a pasting scheme $G$ in $\cal A$ is the arrow of $\cal A$ obtained by composing the sequence of arrows in $A$ given by the $h(G_{1})$.
Definition 3.1. A deformation $\hat{\cal C}$ of a $k$-linear category $\cal C$ is an $R$-linear category (i.e. a category enriched in $R$-modules), for $R$ a unital commutative local $k$-algebra, with maximal ideal ${m}$, whose objects are those of $\cal C$, with $\hat{\cal C}(X,Y)={\cal C}(X,Y)\otimes_{k}R$, whose composition and identity arrows reduce modulo ${m}$ to those of $\cal C$. For $R$ as above, an ${m}$-adic deformation $\hat{\cal C}$ of a $k$-linear category $\cal C$ is a category enriched in the category of ${m}$-adically complete $R$-modules with obvious the monoidal structure given $\hat{\otimes}_{R}$, the ${m}$-adic completion of $\otimes_{R}$, whose objects are those of $\cal C$, with $\hat{\cal C}(X,Y)={\cal C}(X,Y)\hat{\otimes}_{k}R$, whose composition and identity arrows reduce modulo ${m}$ to those of $\cal C$. Two deformations in either sense are equivalent if there is an isomorphism of categories between them that reduces to the identity functor modulo ${m}$. We refer to such an isomorphism as an equivalence of deformations. The trivial deformation is the deformation in which the composition on the original category is simply extended by bilinearity, or by bilinearity and continuity in the ${m}$-adic case, while a trivial deformation is one equivalent to the trivial deformation.
Definition 2.8. A composable 2-pasting diagram in a 2-computad $H$ consists of a $2$-pasting scheme and a 2-computad morphism $h:C(G)\rightarrow H$. In the case where $H$ is the underlying $2$-computad of a 2-category $\cal A$, we call the $2$-pasting diagram a labelling of $G$ in $\cal A$. We denoted the set of composable $2$-pasting diagrams in a $2$-computad $H$ by $diags(H)$.
Definition 3.10. A deformation $\hat{\sigma}$ of a natural transformation $\sigma:F\Rightarrow G$ (for functors $F,G:{\cal C}\rightarrow{\cal D}$ is a five-tuple $(\hat{\cal C},\hat{\cal D},\hat{F},\hat{G},\hat{\sigma})$, where $\hat{\cal C}$ (resp. $\hat{\cal D},\hat{F},\hat{G}$) is a deformation of $\cal C$ (resp. ${\cal D},F,G$), and $\hat{\sigma}$ is a natural transformation from $\hat{F}$ to $\hat{G}$, which reduces modulo ${m}$ to $\sigma$.
Definition 2.1. A $1$-computad is a (finite) directed graph . A $1$-computad morphism is a map of directed graphs.
Definition 3.11. Two deformations $(\hat{\cal C},\hat{\cal D},\hat{F},\hat{G},\hat{\sigma})$ and $(\tilde{\cal C},\tilde{\cal D},\tilde{F},\tilde{G},\tilde{\sigma})$ of a natural transformation $\sigma$ are strongly equivalent if $(\hat{\cal C},\hat{\cal D},\hat{F},\hat{G})=(\tilde{\cal C},\tilde{\cal D},% \tilde{F},\tilde{G})$. Two deformations $(\hat{\cal C},\hat{\cal D},\hat{F},\hat{G},\hat{\sigma})$ and $(\tilde{\cal C},\tilde{\cal D},\tilde{F},\tilde{G},\tilde{\sigma})$ are equivalent if $\hat{\cal C}=\tilde{\cal C}$, $\hat{\cal D}=\tilde{\cal D}$, and $\hat{F}$ (resp. $\hat{G}$) is strongly equivalent to $\tilde{F}$ (resp. $\tilde{G}$) by a strong equivalence of deformations of functors $\phi$ (resp. $\gamma$), and, moreover, $\hat{\sigma}\gamma=\phi\tilde{\sigma})$. Finally, two deformations $(\hat{\cal C},\hat{\cal D},\hat{F},\hat{G},\hat{\sigma})$ and $(\tilde{\cal C},\tilde{\cal D},\tilde{F},\tilde{G},\hat{\sigma})$ are weakly equivalent if there exist equivalences of deformations of categories, $\Gamma:\hat{C}\rightarrow\tilde{C}$ and $\Delta:\hat{D}\rightarrow\tilde{D}$, and a natural isomorphisms $\phi:\hat{F}\Delta\Rightarrow\Gamma\tilde{F}$ (resp. $\psi:\hat{G}\Delta\Rightarrow\Gamma\tilde{G}$), which reduces modulo ${m}$ to $Id_{F}$ (resp. $Id_{G}$), and, moreover $\hat{\sigma}\psi=\phi\tilde{\sigma})$.
Definition 2.2. A $1$-pasting scheme is a finite non-empty set $G$ equipped with an embedding to the oriented line ${R}$. The elements (identified with their images in the line) are called $0$-cells of the pasting scheme, and the open bounded intervals in ${{R}}\setminus G$ are called the $1$-cells of the pasting scheme. Denoting the sets of $0$- and $1$-cells by $G_{0}$ and $G_{1}$ respectively, there is a function $dom:G_{1}\rightarrow G_{0}$, (resp. $cod:G_{1}\rightarrow G_{0}$) the domain (resp. codomain function, which assign the lesser (resp. greater) endpoint to each $1-cell$. The quadruple $(G_{0},G_{1},dom,cod)$ defines a finite directed graph, the underlying 1-computad of the 1-pasting scheme, which we denoted $C(G)$. The domain of G, $domG$ (resp. codomain of G $codG$) is the smallest (resp. largest) element of $G_{0}$. (These should not be confused with the domain and codomain functions.)
Definition 2.5. A general $1$-pasting diagram in a $1$-computad $H$ consists of a $1$-computad $G$ and a $1$-computad morphism $h:G\rightarrow H$. The composable parts of a general $1$-pasting diagram $(G,h)$ are all composable $1$-pasting diagrams $p:C(S)\rightarrow H$ in $H$ that factor as $C(S)\stackrel{{\scriptstyle\tilde{p}}}{{\rightarrow}}G\stackrel{{\scriptstyle h% }}{{\rightarrow}}H$.
Definition 3.5. A deformation $\hat{F}$ of a $k$-linear functor $F:{\cal C}\rightarrow{\cal D}$ is a triple $(\hat{\cal C},\hat{\cal D},\hat{F})$, where $\hat{\cal C}$ (resp. $\hat{\cal D}$) is a deformation of $\cal C$ (resp. $\cal D$) over the same local ring $R$, and $\hat{F}$ is a functor enriched in the category of $R$-modules or ${m}$-adically complete $R$-modules, as appropriate, from $\hat{\cal C}$ to $\hat{\cal D}$ that reduces modulo ${m}$ to $F$.
Definition 2.10. A general 2-pasting diagram in a 2-computad $H$ consists of a 2-computad $G$ and a 2-computad morphism $h:G\rightarrow H$. The composable parts of a general $2$-pasting diagram $(G,h)$ are all composable $2$-pasting diagrams in $H$ $p:C(S)\rightarrow H$ that factor as $C(S)\stackrel{{\scriptstyle\tilde{p}}}{{\rightarrow}}G\stackrel{{\scriptstyle h% }}{{\rightarrow}}H$.
Definition 2.3. A composable $1$-pasting diagram in a $1$-computad $H$ consists of a $1$-pasting scheme and a $1$-computad morphism $h:C(G)\rightarrow H$. The domain (resp. codomain) of the $1$-pasting diagram is $h(domG)$ (resp. $h(codG)$). In the case where $H$ is the underlying $1$-computad of a category $\cal A$, we call the $1$-pasting diagram a labelling of $G$ in $\cal A$. We denoted the set of composable $1$-pasting diagrams in a $1$-computad $H$ by $diags(H)$.
Definition 2.7. A $2$-pasting scheme consists of a finite $1$-computad $G$ together with an embedding of the underlying geometric directed graph (also denoted $G$ by abuse of notation) into the oriented plane ${{R}}^{2}$ satisfying the following conditions: 1. The complement of the image of $G$ consists of an unbounded region and finitely many open cells, which are called faces; 2. The boundary of each bounded face $F$ is of the form $\sigma(F)\cup-\tau(F)$, where the negation indicates orientation reversal, each of $\sigma(F)$ and $\tau(F)$ are images of composable $1$-pasting diagrams in $G$, and $dom\sigma(F)=dom\tau(F)$ (resp. $cod\sigma(F)=cod\tau(F)$); and 3. There exist vertices $s(G)$ and $t(G)$ in the boundary of the unbounded face such that for every vertex $v$, there is a composable $1$-pasting diagram $h:C(H)\rightarrow G$ such that $v$ is in the image of $h$, $domh=s(G)$ and $codh=t(G)$. It follows from these conditions that the boundary of the unbounded face $E$ is also a union of images of composable $1$-pasting diagrams $-\sigma(E)\cup\tau(E)$ (note the orientation reversal) with $dom\sigma(E)=dom\tau(E)=s(G)$ and $cod\sigma(E)=cod\tau(E)=t(G)$. We define the domain (resp. codomain) of $G$ by $domG=\sigma(E)$ (resp. $codG=\tau(E)$).
Definition 2.12. A $k$-linear pasting diagram is a $3$-computad $G$ together with a $3$-computad morphism to the underlying $3$-computad of $k-Cat$, the 2-category of all small $k$-linear categories, $k$-linear functors, and natural transformations.
Definition 4.4. The Hochschild complex of a functor $F$ is $(C^{\bullet}(F),\delta):=(C^{\bullet}(F,F),\delta).$ The Hochschild complex of a $k$-linear category $\cal C$ is $(C^{\bullet}({\cal C}),\delta):=(C^{\bullet}(Id_{\cal C},Id_{\cal C}),\delta).$
Definition 3.3. For any subcategory $\mathcal{D}\subseteq\mathcal{C}$, define its support $\mbox{Supp}(\mathcal{D}):=\{X\in B\mid\mathcal{D}\cap\mathcal{C}_{X}\not=\{0\}\}$. We will say that $\mathcal{C}$ is faithfully graded by $(R,\,B)$ if $\mathcal{C}_{X}\not=\{0\}$ and $\mbox{Supp}(\mathcal{C}_{X}\otimes\mathcal{C}_{Y})=\{W\in B\mid W\text{ is % contained in }XY\}$, for all $X,Y\in B$.
Definition 2.1 ([O1]). A based ring is a pair $(R,\,B)$ consisting of a ring $R$ (with identity $1$) with a $\mathbb{Z}_{+}$-basis $B$ satisfying the following properties: (1) $1\in B$. (2) There is an involution $X\mapsto X^{*}$ of $B$ such that the induced map $X=\sum_{W\in B}a_{W}W\mapsto X^{*}=\sum_{W\in B}a_{W}W^{*}$ satisfies $(XY,\,Z)=(X,ZY^{*})=(Y,\,X^{*}Z)$ for all $X,Y,Z\in R$.
Definition 3.1. A fusion category $\mathcal{C}$ is said to be graded by a based ring $(R,\,B)$ if $\mathcal{C}$ decomposes into a direct sum of full abelian subcategories $\mathcal{C}=\oplus_{X\in B}\,\mathcal{C}_{X}$ such that $(\mathcal{C}_{X})^{*}=\mathcal{C}_{X^{*}}$ and $\mathcal{C}_{X}\otimes\mathcal{C}_{Y}\subseteq\oplus_{Z\in\{W\in B\mid W\text{% is contained in }XY\}}\,\mathcal{C}_{Z}$, for all $X,Y\in B$.
Definition 4 Let $A$ be a C*-algebra in Sets. The functor $\underline{A}:\mathcal{C}(A)\to\mbox{{Sets}}$ is given on objects by $\underline{A}(C)=C,$ and on morphisms $D\subseteq C$ of $\mathcal{C}(A)$ as the inclusion $\underline{A}(D)\hookrightarrow\underline{A}(C)$.
Definition 11 A probability valuation on a locale $X$ is a monotone map $\mu:{\mathcal{O}}(X)\rightarrow[0,1]_{l}$ that satisfies the usual additivity and regularity conditions for measures, i.e. $\mu(U)+\mu(V)=\mu(U\wedge V)+\mu(U\vee V)$ and $\mu(\bigvee_{\lambda}U_{\lambda})=\bigvee_{\lambda}\mu(U_{\lambda})$ for any directed family. (Here, $[0,1]_{l}$ is the collection of lower reals between 0 and 1.)
Definition 9 A Riesz space or vector lattice is a partially ordered vector space $(R,\leqslant)$ over ${\mathbb{R}}$ (i.e. a real vector space $R$ with partial ordering $\leqslant$ such that $f\leqslant g$ implies $f+h\leqslant g+h$ for all $h$ and $f\geq 0$ implies $rf\geq 0$ for all $r\in{\mathbb{R}}^{+}$) that is a distributive lattice with respect to its partial order [62, Definition 11.1]. An f-algebra is a commutative, unital, real algebra $R$ whose underlying vector space is a Riesz space in which $f,g\geq 0$ implies $fg\geq 0$, and $f\wedge g=0$ implies $hf\wedge g=0$ for all $h\geq 0$. Moreover, the multiplicative unit $1$ has to be strong in the sense that for each $f\in R$ there exists a natural number $n$ such that $-n1\leqslant f\leqslant n1$ [82, Definition 140.8].
Definition 18 Let $(L,\vartriangleleft)$ and $(M,\mathop{\blacktriangleleft})$ be meet semilattices with covering relation as above, and let $f^{*}:L\rightarrow{\mathcal{P}}(M)$ be such that: 1. $f^{*}(L)=M$;26If $L$ and $M$ have top elements $\top_{L}$ and $\top_{M}$, respectively, then this condition may be replaced by $f^{*}(\top_{L})=\top_{M}$. 2. $f^{*}(x)\wedge f^{*}(y)\mathop{\blacktriangleleft}f^{*}(x\wedge y)$; 3. $x\vartriangleleft U\Rightarrow f^{*}(x)\mathop{\blacktriangleleft}f^{*}(U)$ (where $f^{*}(U)=\bigcup_{u\in U}f(U)$). Define two such maps $f^{*}_{1},f^{*}_{2}$ to be equivalent if $f^{*}_{1}(x)\sim f^{*}_{2}(x)$ (i.e. $f^{*}_{1}(x)\mathop{\blacktriangleleft}f^{*}_{2}(x)$ and $f^{*}_{2}(x)\mathop{\blacktriangleleft}f^{*}_{1}(x)$) for all $x\in L$. A continuous map $f:(M,\mathop{\blacktriangleleft})\rightarrow(L,\vartriangleleft)$ is an equivalence class of such maps $f^{*}:L\rightarrow{\mathcal{P}}(M)$.27 Instead of taking equivalence classes, one could demand as a fourth condition that $f^{*}(x)=\mathcal{A}f^{*}(x)$ for all $x\in L$.
Definition 10 An integral on an ordered vector space $R$ is a linear functional $I:R\to\mathbb{R}$ that is positive, i.e. if $f\geq 0$ then also $I(f)\geq 0$. If $R$ has a strong unit $1$ (e.g., the multiplicative unit in the case of f-algebras), then an integral $I$ satisfying $I(1)=1$ is called a probability integral. An integral is faithful when its kernel is $\{0\}$, i.e., when $I(f)=0$ and $f\geq 0$ imply $f=0$.
Definition 23 A distributive lattice is normal if for all $b_{1},b_{2}$ such that $b_{1}\vee b_{2}=\top$ there are $c_{1},c_{2}$ such that $c_{1}\wedge c_{2}=\bot$ and $c_{1}\vee b_{1}=\top$ and $c_{2}\vee b_{2}=\top$. A distributive lattice is called strongly normal if for all $a,b$ there exist $x,y$ such that $a\leqslant b\vee x$ and $b\leqslant a\vee y$ and $x\wedge y=\bot.$
Definition 7 A quasi-linear functional on a C*-algebra $A$ is a map $\rho:A\rightarrow\mathbb{C}$ that is linear on all commutative subalgebras and satisfies $\rho(a+ib)=\rho(a)+i\rho(b)$ for all self-adjoint $a,b\in A$ (possibly non-commuting). It is called positive when $\rho(a^{*}a)\geq 0$ for all $a\in A$. When $A$ is unital, a positive quasi-linear functional is called a quasi-state when $\rho(1)=1$.
Definition 16 A covering relation on $L$ is a relation $\vartriangleleft\,\subseteq L\times{\mathcal{P}}(L)$ - equivalently, a function $L\rightarrow{\mathcal{P}}({\mathcal{P}}(L))$ - written $x\vartriangleleft U$ when $(x,U)\in\,\vartriangleleft$, such that: 1. If $x\in U$ then $x\vartriangleleft U$; 2. If $x\vartriangleleft U$ and $U\vartriangleleft V$ (i.e. $y\vartriangleleft V$ for all $y\in U$) then $x\vartriangleleft V$; 3. If $x\vartriangleleft U$ then $x\wedge y\vartriangleleft U$; 4. If $x\in U$ and $x\in V$, then $x\vartriangleleft U\wedge V$ (where $U\wedge V=\{x\wedge y\mid x\in U,y\in V\}$).
Definition A.7. Let $X$ be a flow. Then the $(n+1)$-th merging homology group $H_{n+1}^{+}(X)$ is defined as the $n$-th homology group of the augmented simplicial set $\mathcal{N}^{+}_{*}(X)$ defined as follows: (1) $\mathcal{N}^{+}_{n}(X)=\operatorname{Sing}_{n}(\operatorname{ho\mathbb{P}}^{+}X)$ for $n\geqslant 0$ (2) $\mathcal{N}^{+}_{-1}(X)=X^{0}$ (3) the augmentation map $\epsilon:\operatorname{Sing}_{0}(\operatorname{ho\mathbb{P}}^{+}X)% \longrightarrow X^{0}$ is induced by the mapping $\gamma\mapsto s(\gamma)$ from $\operatorname{ho\mathbb{P}}^{+}X=\operatorname{Sing}_{0}(\operatorname{ho% \mathbb{P}}^{+}X)$ to $X^{0}$ where $\operatorname{Sing}(Z)$ denotes the singular simplicial nerve of a given topological space $Z$. In other terms, (1) for $n\geqslant 1$, $H_{n+1}^{+}(X):=H_{n}(\operatorname{ho\mathbb{P}}^{+}X)$ (2) $H_{1}^{+}(X):=\ker(\epsilon)/\operatorname{im}\left(\partial:\mathcal{N}^{+}_{% 1}(X)\rightarrow\mathcal{N}^{+}_{0}(X)\right)$ (3) $H_{0}^{+}(X):=\mathbb{Z}(X^{0})/\operatorname{im}(\epsilon)$. where $\partial$ is the simplicial differential map, where $\ker(f)$ is the kernel of $f$ and where $\operatorname{im}(f)$ is the kernel of $f$.
Definition 5.6. The homotopy branching space $\operatorname{ho\mathbb{P}}^{-}X$ of a flow $X$ is by definition the topological space $\mathbb{P}^{-}Q(X)$. If $\alpha\in X^{0}$, let $\operatorname{ho\mathbb{P}}^{-}_{\alpha}X=\mathbb{P}^{-}_{\alpha}Q(X)$.
Definition 2.4. [Gau03] Let $Z$ be a topological space. Then the globe of $Z$ is the flow ${\rm{Glob}}(Z)$ defined as follows: ${\rm{Glob}}(Z)^{0}=\{0,1\}$, $\mathbb{P}{\rm{Glob}}(Z)=Z$, $s=0$, $t=1$ and the composition law is trivial. The mapping ${\rm{Glob}}:{\rm{\mathbf{Top}}}\longrightarrow{\rm{\mathbf{Flow}}}$ gives rise to a functor in an obvious way.
Definition 2.1. Let $i:A\longrightarrow B$ and $p:X\longrightarrow Y$ be maps in a category $\mathcal{C}$. Then $i$ has the left lifting property (LLP) with respect to $p$ (or $p$ has the right lifting property (RLP) with respect to $i$) if for any commutative square $\xymatrix{A\ar@{->}[d]_{i}\ar@{->}[r]^{-}{\alpha}&X\ar@{->}[d]_{p}\\ B\ar@{-->}[ru]^{g}\ar@{->}[r]^{-}{\beta}&Y}$ there exists $g$ making both triangles commutative.
Definition 7.2. Let $X$ be a flow. Let $A$ and $B$ be two subsets of $X^{0}$. One says that $A$ is surrounded by $B$ (in $X$) if for any $\alpha\in A$, either $\alpha\in B$ or there exists execution paths $\gamma_{1}$ and $\gamma_{2}$ of $\mathbb{P}X$ such that $s(\gamma_{1})\in B$, $t(\gamma_{1})=s(\gamma_{2})=\alpha$ and $t(\gamma_{2})\in B$. We denote this situation by $A\lll B$.
Definition A.2. Let $X$ be a flow. The topological space $\mathbb{P}^{+}X$ is called the merging space of the flow $X$. The functor $\mathbb{P}^{+}$ is called the merging space functor.
Definition 2.2. [Gau03] A flow $X$ consists of a compactly generated topological space $\mathbb{P}X$, a discrete space $X^{0}$, two continuous maps $s$ and $t$ called respectively the source map and the target map from $\mathbb{P}X$ to $X^{0}$ and a continuous and associative map $*:\{(x,y)\in\mathbb{P}X\times\mathbb{P}X;t(x)=s(y)\}\longrightarrow\mathbb{P}X$ such that $s(x*y)=s(x)$ and $t(x*y)=t(y)$. A morphism of flows $f:X\longrightarrow Y$ consists of a set map $f^{0}:X^{0}\longrightarrow Y^{0}$ together with a continuous map $\mathbb{P}f:\mathbb{P}X\longrightarrow\mathbb{P}Y$ such that $f(s(x))=s(f(x))$, $f(t(x))=t(f(x))$ and $f(x*y)=f(x)*f(y)$. The corresponding category is denoted by ${\rm{\mathbf{Flow}}}$.
Definition 3.2. Let $X$ be a flow. The topological space $\mathbb{P}^{-}X$ is called the branching space of the flow $X$. The functor $\mathbb{P}^{-}$ is called the branching space functor.
Definition 7.3. [Gau05] A morphism of flows $f:X\longrightarrow Y$ is a T-homotopy equivalence if and only if the following conditions are satisfied: (1) The morphism of flows $f:X\longrightarrow Y\!\restriction_{(f(X^{0})}$ is an isomorphism of flows. In particular, the set map $f^{0}:X^{0}\longrightarrow Y^{0}$ is one-to-one. (2) For $\alpha\in Y^{0}\backslash f(X^{0})$, the topological spaces $\mathbb{P}^{-}_{\alpha}Y$ and $\mathbb{P}^{+}_{\alpha}Y$ (cf. Proposition A.1 and Definition A.2) are singletons. (3) $Y^{0}\lll f(X^{0})$.
Definition 5.4. [Gau03] The notion of homotopy between cofibrant-fibrant flows is called S-homotopy.
Definition A.5. The homotopy merging space $\operatorname{ho\mathbb{P}}^{+}X$ of a flow $X$ is by definition the topological space $\mathbb{P}^{+}Q(X)$. If $\alpha\in X^{0}$, let $\operatorname{ho\mathbb{P}}^{+}_{\alpha}X=\mathbb{P}^{+}_{\alpha}X$.
Definition 5.1. [Hov99] [Hir03] [DS95] An object $X$ of a model category $\mathcal{C}$ is cofibrant (resp. fibrant) if and only if the canonical morphism $\varnothing\longrightarrow X$ from the initial object of $\mathcal{C}$ to $X$ (resp. the canonical morphism $X\longrightarrow\mathbf{1}$ from $X$ to the final object $\mathbf{1}$) is a cofibration (resp. a fibration).
Definition 6.1. Let $X$ be a flow. Then the $(n+1)$-th branching homology group $H_{n+1}^{-}(X)$ is defined as the $n$-th homology group of the augmented simplicial set $\mathcal{N}^{-}_{*}(X)$ defined as follows: (1) $\mathcal{N}^{-}_{n}(X)=\operatorname{Sing}_{n}(\operatorname{ho\mathbb{P}}^{-}X)$ for $n\geqslant 0$ (2) $\mathcal{N}^{-}_{-1}(X)=X^{0}$ (3) the augmentation map $\epsilon:\operatorname{Sing}_{0}(\operatorname{ho\mathbb{P}}^{-}X)% \longrightarrow X^{0}$ is induced by the mapping $\gamma\mapsto s(\gamma)$ from $\operatorname{ho\mathbb{P}}^{-}X=\operatorname{Sing}_{0}(\operatorname{ho% \mathbb{P}}^{-}X)$ to $X^{0}$ where $\operatorname{Sing}(Z)$ denotes the singular simplicial nerve of a given topological space $Z$ [GJ99]. In other terms, (1) for $n\geqslant 1$, $H_{n+1}^{-}(X):=H_{n}(\operatorname{ho\mathbb{P}}^{-}X)$ (2) $H_{1}^{-}(X):=\ker(\epsilon)/\operatorname{im}\left(\partial:\mathcal{N}^{-}_{% 1}(X)\rightarrow\mathcal{N}^{-}_{0}(X)\right)$ (3) $H_{0}^{-}(X):=\mathbb{Z}(X^{0})/\operatorname{im}(\epsilon)$. where $\partial$ is the simplicial differential map, where $\ker(f)$ is the kernel of $f$ and where $\operatorname{im}(f)$ is the image of $f$.
Definition B.2. [Gau03] A non-contracting topological $1$-category $X$ is a pair of compactly generated topological spaces $(X^{0},\mathbb{P}X)$ together with continuous maps $s$, $t$ and $*$ satisfying the same properties as in the definition of flow except that $X^{0}$ is not necessarily discrete. The corresponding category is denoted by ${\rm{\mathbf{1Cat^{top}_{1}}}}$.
Definition 8.3. Let $f:X\longrightarrow Y$ be a morphism of flows. The cone $Cf$ of $f$ is the homotopy pushout in the category of flows $\xymatrix{X\ar@{->}[r]^{-}{f}\ar@{->}[d]&Y\ar@{->}[d]\\ \textbf{1}\ar@{->}[r]^{-}{}&Cf}$ where 1 is the terminal flow.
DEFINITION 3.3 A Galois covering of $k$-categories under the action of a group $G$ is a functor ${\cal C}\to{\cal B}$ where $G$ acts freely on $\cal C$ and ${\cal B}={\cal C}/G$. The functor is the projection functor.
DEFINITION 2.1 Let $(x_{n+1},x_{n},\dots,x_{1})$ be a $n+1$-sequence of objects of a $k$-category $\cal C$. The $k$-nerve associated to this sequence is the vector space ${}_{x_{n+1}}{\cal C}_{x_{n}}\otimes\dots\otimes{}_{x_{2}}{\cal C}_{x_{1}}.$ The $k$-nerve ${\cal N}_{n}$ of degree $n$ is the direct sum of all the $k$-nerves associated to $n+1$-sequences of objects. We have $\displaystyle{\cal N}_{0}$ $\displaystyle=$ $\displaystyle\bigoplus_{x\in{\cal C}_{0}}{}_{x}{\cal C}_{x}$ $\displaystyle{\cal N}_{n}$ $\displaystyle=$ $\displaystyle\bigoplus_{\mbox{\tiny$n+1$-sequences}}{}_{x_{n+1}}{\cal C}_{x_{n% }}\otimes\dots\otimes{}_{x_{2}}{\cal C}_{x_{1}}.$
DEFINITION 2.5 Let $\cal C$ be a $k$-category and let $\cal M$ be a $\cal C$-bimodule. The Hochschild-Mitchell homology $H_{*}({\cal C},{\cal M})$ is the homology of the chain complex $\dots\longrightarrow{\cal M}\otimes{\cal N}_{n}\stackrel{{\scriptstyle d}}{{% \longrightarrow}}\dots\stackrel{{\scriptstyle d}}{{\longrightarrow}}{\cal M}% \otimes{\cal N}_{1}\longrightarrow\bigoplus_{x}{}_{x}{\cal M}_{x}\longrightarrow 0$ where $C_{n}({\cal C},{\cal M})={\cal M}\otimes{\cal N}_{n}=\bigoplus_{\mbox{\tiny$n% \!+\!1$-sequences}}{}_{x_{1}}{\cal M}_{x_{n+1}}\otimes{}_{x_{n+1}}{\cal C}_{x_% {n}}\otimes\dots\otimes{}_{x_{2}}{\cal C}_{x_{1}}$ and $d$ is given by the usual Hochschild boundary, see for instance [12].
DEFINITION 3.4 Let $\cal M$ be a $\cal B$-bimodule. The lifted $\cal C$-bimodule $L{\cal M}$ is defined by ${}_{y}(L{\cal M})_{x}={}_{\overline{y}}{\cal M}_{\overline{x}}$ with left action ${}_{z}{\cal C}_{y}\otimes{}_{y}(L{\cal M})_{x}\to{}_{z}(L{\cal M})_{x}$ given by ${}_{z}c_{y}\ {}_{y}m_{x}\ =\ {}_{z}({}_{\overline{z}}\overline{c}_{\overline{y% }}\ {}_{\overline{y}}m_{\overline{x}})_{x}$, and right action defined analogously.
DEFINITION 2.2 Let $\cal C$ be a $k$-category and let $\cal M$ be a $\cal C$-bimodule. The Hochschild-Mitchell cohomology $H^{*}({\cal C},{\cal M})$ is the cohomology of the cochain complex $0\longrightarrow\prod_{x}{}_{x}{\cal M}_{x}\stackrel{{\scriptstyle d}}{{% \longrightarrow}}\mathop{\rm Hom}\nolimits({\cal N}_{1},{\cal M})\stackrel{{% \scriptstyle d}}{{\longrightarrow}}\dots\stackrel{{\scriptstyle d}}{{% \longrightarrow}}\mathop{\rm Hom}\nolimits({\cal N}_{n},{\cal M})\stackrel{{% \scriptstyle d}}{{\longrightarrow}}\dots$ where $C^{n}({\cal C},{\cal M})=\mathop{\rm Hom}\nolimits({\cal N}_{n},{\cal M})=% \prod_{\mbox{\tiny$n+1$-sequences}}\mathop{\rm Hom}\nolimits_{k}({}_{x_{n+1}}{% \cal C}_{x_{n}}\otimes\dots\otimes{}_{x_{2}}{\cal C}_{x_{1}},\ {}_{x_{n+1}}{% \cal M}_{x_{1}})$ and $d$ is given by the usual formulas of Hochschild cohomology as follows. Let $f=\left\{f_{\left(x_{n+1},\dots,\ x_{1}\right)}\right\}_{\mbox{\tiny$n+1$-% sequences}}$ be a family of linear maps. Then $df$ is the family of linear maps $(df)=\left\{df_{{\left(x_{n+2},\cdots,\ x_{1}\right)}}\right\}_{\mbox{\tiny$n+% 2$-sequences}}\mbox{ where }$ $\begin{array}[]{l}df_{\left(x_{n+2},\dots,\ x_{1}\right)}\left({}_{x_{n+2}}c_{% x_{n+1}}\mbox{\footnotesize$\otimes$}\cdots\mbox{\footnotesize$\otimes$}{}_{x_% {2}}c_{x_{1}}\right)=\\ (-1)^{n+1}\left({}_{x_{n+2}}c_{x_{n+1}}\right)f_{\left(x_{n+1},\dots,\ x_{1}% \right)}\left({}_{x_{n+1}}c_{x_{n}}\mbox{\footnotesize$\otimes$}\cdots\mbox{% \footnotesize$\otimes$}{}_{x_{2}}c_{x_{1}}\right)+\\ \sum_{i=1}^{i=n}(-1)^{i}f_{\left(x_{n+2},\dots,\ x_{i+2},\ x_{i},\dots\ x_{1}% \right)}\left({}_{x_{n+2}}c_{x_{n}}\mbox{\footnotesize$\otimes$}\cdots\mbox{% \footnotesize$\otimes$}\left({}_{x_{i+2}}c_{x_{i+1}}\right)\left({}_{x_{i+1}}c% _{x_{i}}\right)\mbox{\footnotesize$\otimes$}\cdots\mbox{\footnotesize$\otimes$% }{}_{x_{2}}c_{x_{1}}\right)+\\ f_{\left(x_{n+2},\dots,\ x_{2}\right)}\left({}_{x_{n+2}}c_{x_{n+1}}\mbox{% \footnotesize$\otimes$}\cdots\mbox{\footnotesize$\otimes$}{}_{x_{3}}c_{x_{2}}% \right)\left({}_{x_{2}}c_{x_{1}}\right).\end{array}$ Note that each linear map of the family $df$ is well defined.
Definition 3.3. Let $P$ be a finite partially ordered set. Consider $P$ as a metric space by the standard discrete metric $d(x,y)=1-\delta_{xy}$ for any $x$ and $y$ in $P$. The geometric realization of $P$, denoted $|P|$, is the set of all order preserving upper semi-continuous maps $f:I\rightarrow P$. We give $|P|$ the structure of a metric space by the metric $d(f,g)=\int_{0}^{1}d(f(t),g(t))dt.$
