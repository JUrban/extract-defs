Definition 4.8. The category $\nabla$ is the semidirect product $\Delta\rtimes C_{2}$, where $C_{2}$ acts on $\Delta$ by the involution $\mathcal{F}$ sending a function $f:[m]\to[n]$ to $\tau^{m}\circ f\circ\tau^{n}$, where $\tau^{n}$ is the order-reversing bijection on $[n]$.
Definition 2.1. Let $F:\mathcal{N}\to\mathcal{M}$ be a functor between model categories. If $F$ creates weak equivalences and fibrations then we call the model structure on $\mathcal{N}$ right-induced (leaving $F$ implicit). We also sometimes say the model structure is lifted from $\mathcal{M}$ or along $F$.
Definition 3.3.5. A map of rings $R\to S$ is called a homological epimorphism if the map $S\otimes^{\mathbb{L}}_{R}S\to S$ is a quasi-isomorphism.
Definition 4.2.1. For a sequence of objects $Y_{i}$ of $\underline{C}$ for $i\geq 0$ and maps $\phi_{i}:Y_{i}\to Y_{i+1}$ we consider $D=\coprod Y_{i}$ and the morphism $a:\oplus\operatorname{id}_{Y_{i}}\bigoplus\oplus(-\phi_{i}):D\to D$ (we can define it since its $i$-th component can be easily factorized as the composition $Y_{i}\to Y_{i}\bigoplus Y_{i+1}\to D$). Denote a cone of $a$ by $Y$. We will write $Y=\operatorname{\varinjlim}Y_{i}$ and call $Y$ a homotopy colimit of $Y_{i}$.
Definition 3.3.1. Let $R$ be a ring and $B$ a set of compact objects of $D(R)$. The generalized universal localization of $R$ with respect to $B$ is the initial object in the category of ring homomorphisms $R\to S^{\prime}$ such that $T\otimes^{\mathbb{L}}_{R}S^{\prime}\cong 0$ for any $T\in B$.
Definition 1.2.1. A couple of subclasses $\underline{C}_{w\leq 0}$ and $\underline{C}_{w\geq 0}\subset\operatorname{Obj}\underline{C}$ will be said to define a weight structure $w$ for a triangulated category $\underline{C}$ if they satisfy the following conditions. (i) $\underline{C}_{w\leq 0}$ and $\underline{C}_{w\geq 0}$ are retraction-closed in $\underline{C}$ (i.e., contain all $\underline{C}$-retracts of their elements). (ii) Semi-invariance with respect to translations. $\underline{C}_{w\leq 0}\subset\underline{C}_{w\leq 0}[1]$ and $\underline{C}_{w\geq 0}[1]\subset\underline{C}_{w\geq 0}$. (iii) Orthogonality. $\underline{C}_{w\leq 0}\perp\underline{C}_{w\geq 0}[1]$. (iv) Weight decompositions. For any $M\in\operatorname{Obj}\underline{C}$ there exists a distinguished triangle $LM\to M\to RM{\to}LM[1]$ such that $LM\in\underline{C}_{w\leq 0}$ and $RM\in\underline{C}_{w\geq 0}[1]$.
Definition 4.1.1. $\operatorname{Obj}K_{\mathfrak{w}}(\underline{B})=\operatorname{Obj}K(% \underline{B})$, and $K_{\mathfrak{w}}(\underline{B})(X,Y)=K_{\mathfrak{w}}(\underline{B})(X,Y)/\backsim$ for complexes $X=(X^{i})$ and $Y=(Y^{i})\in\operatorname{Obj}K_{\mathfrak{w}}(\underline{B})$, where $\backsim$ denotes the following (weak homotopy) relation: $f_{1}=(f_{1}^{i}):X\to Y$ is weakly homotopic to $(f_{2}^{i})$ whenever $f_{1}^{i}-f^{i}_{2}=d^{i-1}_{Y}\circ h^{i}+j^{i+1}\circ d^{i}_{X}$ for some collections of arrows $j^{*},h^{*}:X^{*}\to X^{*-1}$ and all $i\in{\mathbb{Z}}$.
Definition 1.2.2. Let $i,j\in{\mathbb{Z}}$; assume that $\underline{C}$ is a triangulated category endowed with a weight structure $w$. 1. The full subcategory ${\underline{Hw}}\subset\underline{C}$ whose object class is $\underline{C}_{w=0}=\underline{C}_{w\geq 0}\cap\underline{C}_{w\leq 0}$ is called the heart of $w$. 2. $\underline{C}_{w\geq i}$ (resp. $\underline{C}_{w\leq i}$, $\underline{C}_{w=i}$) will denote $\underline{C}_{w\geq 0}[i]$ (resp. $\underline{C}_{w\leq 0}[i]$, $\underline{C}_{w=0}[i]$). 3. $\underline{C}_{[i,j]}$ denotes $\underline{C}_{w\geq i}\cap\underline{C}_{w\leq j}$; so, this class equals $\{0\}$ if $i>j$. $\underline{C}^{b}\subset\underline{C}$ (resp. $\underline{C}_{-}$, resp. $\underline{C}_{+})$ will be the full subcategory of $\underline{C}$ whose object class is $\cup_{i,j\in{\mathbb{Z}}}\underline{C}_{[i,j]}$ (resp. $\cup_{i\in{\mathbb{Z}}}\underline{C}_{w\leq i}$, resp. $\cup_{i\in{\mathbb{Z}}}\underline{C}_{w\geq i}$). We will say that the objects of these subcategories are $w$-bounded, $w$-bounded above, and $w$-bounded below, respectively. 4. We will say that $M\in\operatorname{Obj}\underline{C}$ is right (resp. left) $w$-degenerate if it belongs to $\cap_{l\in z}\underline{C}_{w\leq l}$ (resp. to $\cap_{l\in{\mathbb{Z}}}\underline{C}_{w\geq l}$). Respectively, we will say that $w$ is right (resp. left) non-degenerate whenever all its right (resp. left) degenerate objects are zero. 5. Let $\underline{C}^{\prime}$ be a triangulated category endowed with a weight structure $w^{\prime}$; let $F:\underline{C}\to\underline{C}^{\prime}$ be an exact functor. We will say that $F$ is left weight-exact (with respect to $w,w^{\prime}$) if it maps $\underline{C}_{w\leq 0}$ into $\underline{C}^{\prime}_{w^{\prime}\leq 0}$; it will be called right weight-exact if it sends $\underline{C}_{w\geq 0}$ into $\underline{C}^{\prime}_{w^{\prime}\geq 0}$. $F$ is called weight-exact if it is both left and right weight-exact. In the latter case $F$ obviously restricts to an additive functor ${\underline{Hw}}\to{\underline{Hw}}^{\prime}$ that will be denoted by ${\underline{HF}}$. 6. For a triangulated subcategory $\underline{D}\subset\underline{C}$ we will say that $w$ restricts to $\underline{D}$ whenever the couple $(\underline{C}_{w\leq 0}\cap\operatorname{Obj}\underline{D},\underline{C}_{w% \geq 0}\cap\operatorname{Obj}\underline{D})$ gives a weight structure $w_{\underline{D}}$ for $\underline{D}$. 7. For a regular cardinal $\alpha$ we will say that $w$ is $\alpha$-smashing (resp.. smashing) if $\underline{C}$ is $\alpha$-smashing (resp.. smashing) and the class $\underline{C}_{w\geq 0}$ is so also (and we will not usually mention that $\underline{C}$ is $\alpha$-smashing or smashing, respectively). 8. We will say that a class $\mathcal{P}\subset\operatorname{Obj}\underline{C}$ $\alpha$-generates (resp., class-generates) $w$ whenever $\underline{C}$ is $\alpha$-smashing, $\underline{C}_{w\geq 0}=[\cup_{i\geq 0}\mathcal{P}[i]]]^{\alpha}$, and $\underline{C}_{w\leq 0}=[\cup_{i\leq 0}\mathcal{P}[i]]]^{\alpha}$ (resp., $\underline{C}$ is smashing, $\underline{C}_{w\geq 0}=[\cup_{i\geq 0}\mathcal{P}[i]]]^{\operatorname{big}}$, and $\underline{C}_{w\leq 0}=[\cup_{i\leq 0}\mathcal{P}[i]]]^{\operatorname{big}}$; see ยง1.1). 9. We will say that $\mathcal{P}\subset\operatorname{Obj}\underline{C}$ generates $w$ if $\underline{C}_{w\geq 0}=(\cup_{i<0}\mathcal{P}[i]){}^{\perp}$. 10. Let $\mathcal{P}$ be a class of objects of an $\alpha$-smashing (resp., smashing) triangulated category $\underline{D}$. We will say that $\mathcal{P}$ is $\alpha$-negative (resp., class-negative) (in $\underline{D}$) if $\mathcal{P}\perp_{\underline{D}}[\cup_{i>0}\mathcal{P}[i]]^{\alpha}_{% \underline{D}}$ (resp. $\mathcal{P}\perp_{\underline{D}}[\cup_{i>0}\mathcal{P}[i]]^{\operatorname{big}% }_{\underline{D}}$).11The reader may assume that all negative classes in this paper are additive; yet this is not necessary. ${\aleph_{1}}$-negative classes of objects will also be called countably negative ones.12Theorem 2.2.1(6) below demonstrates that this case of $\alpha$-negativity is of special importance.
Definition 3.4 (R. Thom). The cohomology class $\beta\in H^{q}(X;B)$ depends on the cohomology class $\alpha\in H^{p}(X;A)$, where $A,B$ are coefficient rings, if, for all (perhaps infinite) polyhedra $Y$ and all maps $f:X\to Y$ such that $\alpha\in f^{*}(H^{p}(Y;A))$, we have $\beta\in f^{*}(H^{q}(Y;B))$.
Definition 2.2. Let $\mathscr{E}$ be an additive category and $\mathcal{S}$ a family of kernel-cokernel pairs in $\mathscr{E}$. Assume that $\mathcal{S}$ is closed under isomorphisms and satisfies the following: Ex0${}^{op}$ $1_{0}$ is an admissible epimorphism, where 0 denotes the zero object. Ex1${}^{op}$ The class of admissible epimorphisms is closed under composition. Ex2${}^{op}$ Admissible epimorphisms are stable under pullback along arbitrary morphisms: $\tikzcd B^{\prime}\arrow[r,"g^{\prime}",dashed,twoheads]\arrow[d,"h^{\prime}",% dashed]\arrow[dr,phantom,"\scriptscriptstyle PB"]&C^{\prime}\arrow[d,"h"]\\ B\arrow[r,"g",twoheads]&C$ Ex2${}^{op}$ Admissible monomorphisms are stable under pushout along arbitrary morphisms: $\tikzcd A\arrow[r,"f",tail]\arrow[d,"h"]\arrow[dr,phantom,"\scriptscriptstyle PO% "]&B\arrow[d,"h^{\prime}",dashed]\\ A^{\prime}\arrow[r,"f^{\prime}",dashed,tail]&B^{\prime}$ In this case $\mathcal{S}$ is an exact structure on $\mathscr{E}$ and the pair $(\mathscr{E},\mathcal{S})$ is an exact category. The elements of $\mathcal{S}$ are called short exact sequences.
Definition 2.5. Let $\mathscr{A}$ be a preadditive category and $\mathcal{I}$ an ideal of $\mathscr{A}$. We define the quotient category $\mathscr{A}/\mathcal{I}$ by $\operatorname{obj}\mathscr{A}/\mathcal{I}:=\operatorname{obj}\mathscr{A}$ $\operatorname{Hom}_{\mathscr{A}/\mathcal{I}}(X,Y):=\operatorname{Hom}_{% \mathscr{A}}(X,Y)/\mathcal{I}(X,Y).$ This means that $\mathscr{A}/\mathcal{I}$ has the same objects as $\mathscr{A}$ and that the morphisms in $\mathscr{A}/\mathcal{I}$ are the equivalence classes of the morphisms in $\mathscr{A}$ (two morphisms are equivalent if their difference is in $\mathcal{I}$). The equivalence class of a morphism $f:X\to Y$ in $\mathscr{A}$ will be denoted by $\underline{f}$ in $\mathscr{A}/\mathcal{I}$. When it is clear from the context, the notation $\underline{\operatorname{Hom}}_{\mathscr{A}}(X,Y)$, or simply $\underline{\operatorname{Hom}}(X,Y)$, will be used instead of $\operatorname{Hom}_{\mathscr{A}/\mathcal{I}}(X,Y)$.
Definition 3.5. A (full) subcategory $\mathscr{N}$ of $\mathscr{E}$ is factorization admissible if it is closed under finite direct sums, direct summands and if whenever a morphism $f:X\to Y$ factors through an object in $\mathscr{N}$, then there exists a factorization $\tikzcd[sep=small]X\arrow[rr,"f"]\arrow[dr,"\alpha"^{\prime}]&&Y\\ &N\arrow[ur,"\beta"^{\prime}]&$ with $N\in\mathscr{N}$ such that either $\alpha$ is an admissible monomorphism or $\beta$ is an admissible epimorphism.
Definition 2.1. Let $\mathscr{E}$ be an additive category and $A\xrightarrow{f}B\xrightarrow{g}C$ a sequence in $\mathscr{E}$. We call $(f,g)$ a kernel-cokernel pair if $f$ is a kernel of $g$ and $g$ is a cokernel of $f$. Let $\mathcal{S}$ be a family of kernel-cokernel pairs in $\mathscr{E}$. If $(f,g)\in\mathcal{S}$, then we call $f$ an admissible monomorphism and $g$ an admissible epimorphism.
Definition 3.7. We say that the quotient category $\mathscr{E}/\mathscr{N}$ satisfies the Weak Five Lemma for $\mathcal{S}_{\mathscr{N}}$ if whenever we have a morphism of sequences in $\mathcal{S}_{\mathscr{N}}$ $\tikzcd&X\arrow[r]\arrow[d,"\underline{f}"]&Y\arrow[r]\arrow[d,"\underline{g}"% ]&Z\arrow[d,"\underline{h}"]&\in\mathcal{S}_{\mathscr{N}}\\ &X^{\prime}\arrow[r]&Y^{\prime}\arrow[r]&Z^{\prime}&\in\mathcal{S}_{\mathscr{N}}$ then the following hold: (i) If $\underline{f}$ and $\underline{g}$ are isomorphisms and $Z^{\prime}=0$, then $\underline{h}$ is an isomorphism (i.e. $Z\cong 0$). (ii) Dually, if $\underline{g}$ and $\underline{h}$ are isomorphisms and $X=0$, then $\underline{f}$ is an isomorphism.
Definition 2.7. An exact category $(\mathscr{E},\mathcal{S})$ is Frobenius if it has enough $\mathcal{S}$-projectives, enough $\mathcal{S}$-injectives and if $\operatorname{proj}\mathscr{E}=\operatorname{inj}\mathscr{E}$, where $\operatorname{proj}$ $\mathscr{E}$ and $\operatorname{inj}$ $\mathscr{E}$ denote the collection of $\mathcal{S}$-projective and $\mathcal{S}$-injective objects, respectively. The stable category associated with $\mathscr{E}$ is the quotient category $\underline{\mathscr{E}}:=\mathscr{E}/\operatorname{inj}\mathscr{E}$. We use $\underline{\operatorname{Hom}}(X,Y)$ instead of $\operatorname{Hom}_{\underline{\mathscr{E}}}(X,Y)$ to denote the set of morphisms from $X$ to $Y$ in $\underline{\mathscr{E}}$. The equivalence class of a morphism $f:X\to Y$ in $\mathscr{E}$ will be denoted by $\underline{f}$ in $\underline{\mathscr{E}}$.
Definition 3.10. (a) For a complete subcategory $\mathscr{D}$ of $\mathscr{E}$ containing $\mathscr{N}$, define $F\mathscr{D}$ to be the full subcategory of $\mathscr{E}/\mathscr{N}$ whose objects are the objects of $\mathscr{D}$. (b) For a complete subcategory $\mathscr{D}_{\mathscr{N}}$ of $\mathscr{E}/\mathscr{N}$, define $G\mathscr{D}_{\mathscr{N}}$ to be the full subcategory of $\mathscr{E}$ whose objects are the objects in $\mathscr{D}_{\mathscr{N}}$ (including $\mathscr{N}$).
Definition 3.1. A nonempty subcategory $\mathscr{D}$ of $\mathscr{E}$ (respectively, of $\mathscr{E}/\mathscr{N}$) is a complete subcategory if the following hold (i) $\mathscr{D}$ is a full subcategory, (ii) 2 out of 3: If {tikzcd}[ampersand replacement=&,cramped, sep=scriptsize]X \arrow[r, โfโ, tail] & Y \arrow[r, โgโ, two heads] & Z in $\mathcal{S}$ (respectively, in $\mathcal{S}_{\mathscr{N}}$) and two of $X,Y,Z$ are in $\mathscr{D}$, then so is the third. Moreover, $\mathscr{D}$ is a thick subcategory if in addition the following holds (iii) $\mathscr{D}$ is closed under direct summands, i.e. if $A$ is a direct summand of $X$, then $X\in\mathscr{D}$ implies $A\in\mathscr{D}$.
Definition 3.6. Let $T$ be a coherent theory. We define an inductively generated relation $\mathrel{\vartriangleleft_{T}}$ as in Definition 2.2 for the category $\mathbb{C}_{\mathrm{rn}}$. Since $\mathbb{C}_{\mathrm{rn}}$ is a subcategory of $\mathbb{C}_{\mathrm{ts}}$ and $\mathbb{C}_{\mathrm{vs}}$ containing all isomorphisms, we have then also defined relations $\mathrel{\vartriangleleft_{T}}$ for $\mathbb{C}_{\mathrm{ts}}$ and $\mathbb{C}_{\mathrm{vs}}$. In Theorem 3.8 we will verify that $\mathrel{\vartriangleleft_{T}}$ is a saturated coverage for all three categories, and even a basis for a Grothendieck topology on $\mathbb{C}_{\mathrm{vs}}$. $\frac{\text{$f$ is an isomorphism with codomain $(X;A)$}}{(X;A)\mathrel{% \vartriangleleft_{T}}\{f\}}$ $\frac{(X,\vec{x}_{1};A,\varphi_{1})\mathrel{\vartriangleleft_{T}}U_{1}\quad% \ldots\quad(X,\vec{x}_{n};A,\varphi_{n})\mathrel{\vartriangleleft_{T}}U_{n}}{(% X;A)\mathrel{\vartriangleleft_{T}}\bigcup_{1\leq i\leq n}(e_{i}U_{i})}(*)$ Here $(*)$ is the set of conditions sanctioning the application of the rule: the existence of an instance $\varphi_{0}\to\exists\vec{x}_{1}.\varphi_{1}\lor\cdots\lor\exists\vec{x}_{n}.% \varphi_{n}$ of an axiom in $T$ with all free variables in $X$ and $\varphi_{0}\subseteq A$. We tacitly assume that name conflicts are avoided, either by using de Bruijn indices, or by renaming the bound variables $\vec{x}_{i}$ so that they are disjoint from $X$. The morphisms $e_{i}:(X,\vec{x}_{i};A,\varphi_{i})\to(X;A)$ restrict to identities on $X$, and $e_{i}U_{i}$ denotes the collection of morphisms $e_{i}f$ with $f\in U_{i}$. This completes $(*)$ and the definition of $\mathrel{\vartriangleleft_{T}}$.
Definition 2.11. A functor $F:{\mathbb{C}}\to{\mathbb{D}}$ between sites is a morphism of sites if it satisfies the following two properties: Cover preserving If $U\mathrel{\vartriangleright}C$ in ${\mathbb{C}}$, then there is a cover $V\mathrel{\vartriangleright}FC$ refining $F(U)$. Covering-flat If $A:I\to{\mathbb{C}}$ is a finite diagram in ${\mathbb{C}}$, then every cone over $FA$ factors locally through the $F$-image of a cone over $A$.
Definition 5.1. Let ${\mathbb{C}}$ be one of the categories $\mathbb{C}_{\mathrm{rn}},\mathbb{C}_{\mathrm{vs}}$ or $\mathbb{C}_{\mathrm{ts}}$ and let ${\mathrel{\vartriangleleft}}$ be any coverage on ${\mathbb{C}}$. For any condition $C=(X;A)$ and any formula $\varphi$ with free variables in $X$ we define the forcing relation $C\mathrel{\Vdash}\varphi$ by induction on $\varphi$ as follows: 1. $C\mathrel{\Vdash}\top$ always; 2. $C\mathrel{\Vdash}\bot$ if $C\mathrel{\vartriangleleft}\emptyset$; 3. $C\mathrel{\Vdash}\varphi$ if $\varphi$ is a fact and there is $U\mathrel{\vartriangleright}C$ with $\varphi f\in\operatorname{Fact}(D)$ for all $f:D\to C$ in $U$; 4. $C\mathrel{\Vdash}\bigwedge_{i\in I}\varphi_{i}$ if $C\mathrel{\Vdash}\varphi_{i}$ for all $i\in I$; 5. $C\mathrel{\Vdash}\bigvee_{i\in I}\varphi_{i}$ if there is $U\mathrel{\vartriangleright}C$ such that for all $f:D\to C$ in $U$, $D\mathrel{\Vdash}\varphi_{i}f$ for some $i\in I$; 6. $C\mathrel{\Vdash}\varphi_{1}\to\varphi_{2}$ if for all maps $f:D\to C$ in ${\mathbb{C}}$ we have $D\mathrel{\Vdash}\varphi_{2}f$ whenever $D\mathrel{\Vdash}\varphi_{1}f$; 7. $C\mathrel{\Vdash}\forall x.\varphi$ if for all maps $f:D\to C$ we have $D\mathrel{\Vdash}\varphi[f,x:=t]$ for all $t\in\operatorname{Tm}(D)$; 8. $C\mathrel{\Vdash}\exists x.\varphi$ if there is $U\mathrel{\vartriangleright}C$ such that, for all $f:D\to C$ in $U$, $D\mathrel{\Vdash}\varphi[f,x:=t]$ for some $t\in\operatorname{Tm}(D)$.
Definition 2.18. The class of generalized geometric implications is generated by the following grammar: $\varphi::=\alpha\mid(\varphi_{1}\land\varphi_{2})\mid\bigl{(}\bigvee\nolimits_% {i\in I}\varphi_{i}\bigr{)}\mid(\exists x.\varphi)\mid(\forall x.\varphi)\mid(% \alpha\to\varphi)$ where $I$ ranges over small index sets and $\alpha::=p(\vec{t}\;)\mid\top\mid\bot\mid(s=t)$ is an atomic formula.
Definition 2.6. For a Grothendieck topology $J$ or a saturated coverage $\mathrel{\vartriangleleft}$ on ${\mathbb{C}}$, let $\operatorname{Sh}({\mathbb{C}},J)$, resp. $\operatorname{Sh}({\mathbb{C}},\mathrel{\vartriangleleft})$, be the full subcategory of $\operatorname{PSh}({\mathbb{C}})$ consisting of sheaves wrt. $J$, resp. $\mathrel{\vartriangleleft}$. If $J$ or $\mathrel{\vartriangleleft}$ can be inferred from the context, we just write $\operatorname{Sh}({\mathbb{C}})$. A category equivalent to one of this form is called a Grothendieck topos or a sheaf topos.
Definition 2.14. Given an object $C\in{\mathbb{C}}$ and a tuple of elements $\alpha\in M(C)^{n}=M^{n}(C)$. If $\varphi(\vec{x})$ is a formula with $n$ free variables, then we say that $C$ forces $\varphi(\alpha)$, denoted $C\mathrel{\Vdash}_{M}\varphi(\alpha)$, iff $\alpha$ factors through $\llbracket\varphi(\vec{x})\rrbracket\hookrightarrow M^{n}$, where we consider $\alpha$ as a map $\mathbf{a}\mathbf{y}C\to M^{n}$.
Definition 4.1. A classifying topos for $T$ is a sheaf topos denoted $\textup{Set}[T]$ equipped with a generic model $M_{T}$ of $T$, i.e., the map $F\mapsto F^{*}M_{T}$ induces an equivalence of categories $\operatorname{Hom}(\mathcal{E},\textup{Set}[T])\simeq\textup{Mod}_{T}(\mathcal% {E})$ for every sheaf topos $\mathcal{E}$.
Definition 2.1. A Grothendieck topology on ${\mathbb{C}}$ is a function $J$ that assigns to every object $C$ a collection $J(C)$ of sieves on $C$, such that (i) the maximal sieve $\{\,f\mid\operatorname{cod}(f)=C\,\}$ denoted by $t_{C}$ is in $J(C)$; (ii) (stability) if $S\in J(C)$ and $g:D\to C$, then $g^{*}(S)$ is in $J(D)$; (iii) (transitivity) if $S\in J(C)$ and $R$ is any sieve on $C$ such that $f^{*}(R)\in J(D)$ for every $f:D\to C$ in $S$, then $R$ is in $J(C)$.
Definition 3.2. The category $\mathbb{C}_{\mathrm{vs}}$ is the subcategory of $\mathbb{C}_{\mathrm{ts}}$ that has the same objects but in which the morphisms $f:(Y;B)\to(X;A)$ are required to be variable substitutions. These are simply functions $X\to Y$ thought of as functions $X\to\operatorname{Tm}(Y)$.
Definition 2.8. A functor $F:{\mathbb{C}}\to{\mathbb{D}}$ between sites is a comorphism of sites if it has the following: Covering lifting property For any cover $V\mathrel{\vartriangleright}F(C)$ in ${\mathbb{D}}$ with $C\in{\mathbb{C}}$, there is a cover $U\mathrel{\vartriangleright}C$ in ${\mathbb{C}}$ such that $F(U)$ refines $V$.
Definition 3.1. The category $\mathbb{C}_{\mathrm{ts}}$ has objects denoted as pairs $(X;A)$, where $X$ is a finite subset of X and $A$ is a finite set of atoms in the language defined by $\Sigma$ and $X$. The latter means that only variables from $X$ may occur in $A$. Such pairs $(X;A)$ are called conditions. The morphisms of $\mathbb{C}_{\mathrm{ts}}$ are denoted as $f:(Y;B)\to(X;A)$, where $f$ is a term substitution $X\to\operatorname{Tm}(Y)$ such that $Af\subseteq B$. Here and below, $Af$ denotes the application of the substitution $f$ to $A$.
Definition 2.5. A presheaf $P:{\mathbb{C}}^{\mathrm{op}}\to\textup{Set}$ is a sheaf for the coverage $\mathrel{\vartriangleleft}$, if for every object $C\in{\mathbb{C}}$, every $U\mathrel{\vartriangleright}C$, and every compatible family of elements $(s_{f})_{f\in U}$ for $U$, there exists a unique element $s\in P(C)$ such that $s_{f}=sf$ for all $f\in U$.
Definition 2.13. A structure for $\Sigma$ in a sheaf topos $\operatorname{Sh}({\mathbb{C}},J)$ consists of a sheaf $M$ (the carrier) together with morphisms $\llbracket f\rrbracket_{M}:M^{n}\to M$ for every $n$-ary function symbol, and subobjects of $M^{n}$ denoted $\llbracket P\rrbracket_{M}\hookrightarrow M^{n}$ for every $n$-ary predicate symbol. The latter two are often left implicit when we speak about a structure or model $M$. A homomorphism of $\Sigma$-structures is a morphisms $g:M\to M^{\prime}$ that respects the interpretations of function and predicate symbols.
Definition 3.9. Let $\operatorname{Tm}$ denote the presheaf of terms over the signature in each $\operatorname{PSh}({\mathbb{C}}_{\_})$, so $\operatorname{Tm}(X;A)$ is the set of terms with parameters in $X$. Note that for $\mathbb{C}_{\mathrm{ts}}$ we have $\operatorname{Tm}\cong\mathbf{y}(x;)$, but not for $\mathbb{C}_{\mathrm{vs}},\mathbb{C}_{\mathrm{rn}}$. Now let $M:=\mathbf{a}\operatorname{Tm}$ denote the associated sheaf. If $f$ is an $n$-ary function symbol, define $\llbracket f\rrbracket:M^{n}\to M$ by applying the associated sheaf functor to the natural transformation $\operatorname{Tm}^{n}\to\operatorname{Tm}$ that maps $n$ terms $t_{i}$ at a condition $(X;A)$ to the term $f(t_{1},\dots,t_{n})$. If $p$ is an $n$-ary predicate symbol, define $\llbracket p\rrbracket$ as the associated sheaf of the sub-presheaf of $\operatorname{Tm}^{n}$ that at a condition $(X;A)$ consists of those tuples $(t_{1},\dots,t_{n})$ for which $p(t_{1},\dots,t_{n})\in A$.
Definition 2.2. A basis for a Grothendieck topology on a category ${\mathbb{C}}$ with finite limits consists of a relation $\mathrel{\vartriangleleft}$ between objects $C$ of ${\mathbb{C}}$ and $C$-sinks $U$ (if $C\mathrel{\vartriangleleft}U$ we say that $U$ is a basic cover of $C$) such that the following conditions hold: (i) if $f:D\to C$ is an isomorphism, then $C\mathrel{\vartriangleleft}\{f\}$; (ii) if $C\mathrel{\vartriangleleft}U$ and $g:D\to C$, then $D\mathrel{\vartriangleleft}\{g^{*}f\mid f\in U\}$; (iii) if $C\mathrel{\vartriangleleft}U$ and $D\mathrel{\vartriangleleft}V_{f}$ for each $f:D\to C$ in $U$, then $C\mathrel{\vartriangleleft}\bigcup_{f\in U}{fV_{f}}$. Here and below $g^{*}f$ is the pullback of $f$ along $g$. In case ${\mathbb{C}}$ does not admit finite limits, we have to replace (ii) by a weaker condition, namely that of a coverage. A coverage on a small category ${\mathbb{C}}$ consists of a relation $\mathrel{\vartriangleleft}$ between objects $C$ of ${\mathbb{C}}$ and $C$-sinks $U$ such that (iiโ) if $C\mathrel{\vartriangleleft}U$, and $g:D\to C$, then there exists $V\mathrel{\vartriangleright}D$ such that $gV$ refines $U$. If a coverage also satisfies the conditions (i) and (iii), then it will be called a saturated coverage.2Beware that this terminology is not quite standard: a โsaturated coverageโ is sometimes required to satisfy as well (iv) if $U\mathrel{\vartriangleright}C$ refines a $C$-sink $V$, then already $V\mathrel{\vartriangleright}C$. Saturated coverages in this sense are in bijection with Grothendieck topologies. Note that every basis is a saturated coverage by choosing $V=\{g^{*}f\mid f\in U\}$ in (iiโ).
Definition 3.3. The category $\mathbb{C}_{\mathrm{rn}}$ is the subcategory of $\mathbb{C}_{\mathrm{vs}}$ that has the same objects but in which the morphisms are required to be injective (when considered as functions between sets of variables). Such variable substitutions are commonly called renamings, whence the subscripts in $\mathbb{C}_{\mathrm{vs}},\mathbb{C}_{\mathrm{rn}}$.
Definition 2.4. Let ${\mathbb{C}}$ be a category and $U$ a $C$-sink for some $C\in{\mathbb{C}}$. Write $U=\{f_{i}:C_{i}\to C\}_{i\in I}$. Let $P:{\mathbb{C}}^{\mathrm{op}}\to\textup{Set}$ be a presheaf. A compatible family of elements $s_{i}\in P(C_{i})$ for $U$ is one such that whenever $g:D\to C_{i}$ and $h:D\to C_{j}$ satisfy $f_{i}g=f_{j}h$, then $s_{i}g=s_{j}h$.
Definition 2.16. Given a theory $T$ and a structure $M$ in $\operatorname{Sh}({\mathbb{C}},\mathrel{\vartriangleleft})$, we say that $M$ is a model of $T$ if $\mathrel{\Vdash}_{M}\varphi$ for every sentence $\varphi$ in $T$.
Definition B.5. A family of maps $\{A_{i}\xrightarrow{w_{i}}B\}_{i\in I}$ in $\mathcal{V}$ is jointly regular epi if it is a quotient for some relation.
Definition B.1. A family of maps $\{A_{i}\xrightarrow{w_{i}}B\}_{i\in I}$ in $\mathcal{V}$ is jointly epi if any two maps $B\xrightarrow{f}C$ and $B\xrightarrow{g}C$ satisfying, for all $i$, $f\circ w_{i}=g\circ w_{i}$ implies $f=g$.

A right $\mathcal{C}$-module $M:\mathcal{B}\overset{}{\mathrel{\mathchoice{\ooalign{$\displaystyle% \mapstochar\mskip 5.0mu $\cr$\displaystyle\to$\cr}}{\ooalign{$\textstyle% \mapstochar\mskip 5.0mu $\cr$\textstyle\to$\cr}}{\ooalign{$\scriptstyle% \mapstochar\mskip 5.0mu $\cr$\scriptstyle\to$\cr}}{\ooalign{$% \scriptscriptstyle\mapstochar\mskip 5.0mu $\cr$\scriptscriptstyle\to$\cr}}}}% \mathcal{C}$ is called convergent if there is a $\mathcal{V}$-functor $F:\mathcal{B}\rightarrow\mathcal{C}$ such that $M\cong F_{*}:=\mathcal{C}(-,F-)$.
Definition B.3. A family of maps $\{A_{i}\xrightarrow{w_{i}}B\}_{i\in I}$ in $\mathcal{V}$ is jointly strong epi if it is jointly epi and satisfies the diagonal fill in condition - that any map $B\xrightarrow{g}D$, any mono $C\xrightarrow{m}D$, and any family of maps $\{A_{i}\xrightarrow{f_{i}}C\}_{i\in I}$ such that $m\circ f_{i}=g\circ w_{i}$, there is a unique diagonal filler $B\xrightarrow{d}C$ such that all triangles commute.
Definition 2.1. A symmetric closed monoidal category $\mathcal{R_{\bot}}$ is defined to have โข objects the real positive numbers $[0,\infty)$ with infinity $\infty$ and and the additional object $\bot$ โข arrows $a\rightarrow b$ existing uniquely if $a=\bot$, $b=\infty$ or $a\leq b$, forming a total order โข tensor product $+:\mathcal{R_{\bot}}\times\mathcal{R_{\bot}}\rightarrow\mathcal{R_{\bot}}$ given by + $\bot$ $b$ $\infty$ $\bot$ $\bot$ $\bot$ $\bot$ $a$ $\bot$ $a+b$ $\infty$ $\infty$ $\bot$ $\infty$ $\infty$ โข internal hom $-:\mathcal{R_{\bot}}^{\mathrm{op}}\times\mathcal{R_{\bot}}\rightarrow\mathcal{% R_{\bot}}$ given by - $\bot$ $b$ $\infty$ $\bot$ $\infty$ $\infty$ $\infty$ $a$ $\bot$ $\begin{cases}b-a,&a\leq b\\ \bot,&a>b\end{cases}$ $\infty$ $\infty$ $\bot$ $\bot$ $\infty$
Definition B.2. A family of maps $\{A_{i}\xrightarrow{w_{i}}B\}_{i\in I}$ in $\mathcal{V}$ is jointly extremal epi if it is jointly epi and satisfies the invertible mono condition - that any mono $m$ through which all $w_{i}$ factor is necessarily an isomorphism.
Definition A.1. A $\mathcal{V}$-module $M:\mathcal{B}\overset{}{\mathrel{\mathchoice{\ooalign{$\displaystyle% \mapstochar\mskip 5.0mu $\cr$\displaystyle\to$\cr}}{\ooalign{$\textstyle% \mapstochar\mskip 5.0mu $\cr$\textstyle\to$\cr}}{\ooalign{$\scriptstyle% \mapstochar\mskip 5.0mu $\cr$\scriptstyle\to$\cr}}{\ooalign{$% \scriptscriptstyle\mapstochar\mskip 5.0mu $\cr$\scriptscriptstyle\to$\cr}}}}% \mathcal{C}$ is called Cauchy if it has a right adjoint in $\mathcal{V}\text{-}\mathrm{Mod}.$
Definition B.4. A relation $R$ on a family $\{A_{i}\}_{i\in I}$ of objects in $\mathcal{V}$ is given by a set $R_{i,j}$ of spans between $A_{i}$ and $A_{j}$, for each $i$ and $j$. We use $R$ to denote the (disjoint) union of all $R_{i,j}$. A quotient of $R$ is a family $\{A_{i}\xrightarrow{w_{i}}B\}_{i\in I}$ that is (part of) a colimit cone for the diagram consisting of objects $\{A_{i}\}_{i\in I}$ and spans in $R$ between them. Explicitly, for each span $A_{i}\xleftarrow{x}D\xrightarrow{y}A_{j}$ in $R_{i,j}$, the square $D$$A_{i}$$A_{j}$$B$$x$$w_{j}$$y$$w_{i}$ commutes, and the quotient is a universal family with this property. A kernel of an arbitrary family $\{A_{i}\xrightarrow{w_{i}}B\}_{i\in I}$, denoted $\mathrm{Ker}(\{w_{i}\})$, is the relation containing all spans of the form (71) satisfying (72).
Definition A.3. A $\mathcal{V}$-category $\mathcal{C}$ is Cauchy complete if all Cauchy modules into $\mathcal{C}$ are representable.
Definition 5.1 Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a pivotal category over any field $k$. The Frobenius-Schur exponent of an object $V$ in $\mathcal{C}$, denoted by ${\mbox{\rm FSexp}}(V)$, is defined to be the least positive integer $n$ such that $\nu_{n}(V)=d_{\ell}(V),\,$ where $d_{\ell}(V)$ and $\nu_{n}(V)$, respectively, denote the left pivotal dimension and the $n$-th Frobenius-Schur indicator of $V$. If such an integer does not exist, we define ${\mbox{\rm FSexp}}(V)=\infty$. We call $\sup\limits_{V\in\mathcal{C}}{\mbox{\rm FSexp}}(V)$ the Frobenius-Schur exponent of $\mathcal{C}$ and denote it by ${\mbox{\rm FSexp}}(\mathcal{C})$.
Definition 2.3. The prescribed basis for the chain complex $K$ is unital if $\epsilon(\partial^{-})^{p}b=\epsilon(\partial^{+})^{p}b=1$ whenever $b$ is a basis element of dimension $p$. If $K$ has a unital basis, then the elements $\langle b\rangle$ of $\nu K$ corresponding to the basis elements $b$ are called atoms.
Definition 2.5. The objects of $\mathbf{F}$ are the augmented chain complexes of abelian groups concentrated in nonnegative degrees together with prescribed strongly loop-free unital bases. The morphisms of $\mathbf{F}$ are the augmentation and order-preserving chain maps.
Definition 2.1. The members of the $\omega$-category $\nu K$ are the double sequences $x=(x^{-}_{0},x^{+}_{0}\mid x^{-}_{1},x^{+}_{1}\mid\ldots\,)$ satisfying the following conditions: (1) $x^{-}_{q},x^{+}_{q}\in K_{q}$; (2) there exists $N$ such that $x^{-}_{q}=x^{+}_{q}=0$ for $q>N$; (3) $x^{+}_{q}-x^{-}_{q}=\partial x^{-}_{q+1}=\partial x^{+}_{q+1}$ for $q\geq 0$; (4) $x^{-}_{q}\geq 0$ and $x^{+}_{q}\geq 0$ for $q\geq 0$; (5) $\epsilon x^{-}_{0}=\epsilon x^{+}_{0}=1.$ For $p\geq 0$ we make $\nu K$ into the morphism set of a category as follows: the left identity $d^{-}_{p}x$ and the right identity $d^{+}_{p}x$ of the element $x=(x^{-}_{0},x^{+}_{0}\mid x^{-}_{1},x^{+}_{1}\mid\ldots\,)$ are given by $d^{-}_{p}x=(x^{-}_{0},x^{+}_{0}\mid\ldots\mid x^{-}_{p-1},x^{+}_{p-1}\mid x^{-% }_{p},x^{-}_{p}\mid 0,0\mid\ldots\,)$ and $d^{+}_{p}x=(x^{-}_{0},x^{+}_{0}\mid\ldots\mid x^{-}_{p-1},x^{+}_{p-1}\mid x^{+% }_{p},x^{+}_{p}\mid 0,0\mid\ldots\,);$ if $x$ and $y$ are elements such that $d^{+}_{p}x=d^{-}_{p}y$, say $d^{+}_{p}x=d^{-}_{p}y=w$, then the composite $x\operatorname{\#}_{p}y$ is given by $x\operatorname{\#}_{p}y=x-w+y,$ where the addition and subtraction are performed termwise.
Definition 2.4. The prescribed basis for the chain complex $K$ is strongly loop-free if it has a partial ordering such that $a<b$ whenever $a$ is an element with a negative coefficient in $\partial b$ or $b$ is an element with a positive coefficient in $\partial a$.
Definition 5.1. Let $x$ and $y$ be morphisms in $\mathbf{Z}\Delta(m,n)$ such that $\partial_{i}x=\partial_{i+1}y$ for some $i$ with $0\leq i\leq m-1$. Then $x\operatorname{\bigtriangledown}_{i}y$ is the morphism in $\mathbf{Z}\Delta(m+1,n)$ given by $x\operatorname{\bigtriangledown}_{i}y=\epsilon_{i+1}x-\epsilon_{i}\epsilon_{i}% \partial_{i}x+\epsilon_{i}y$ and $x\vee_{i}y$ is the morphism in $\mathbf{Z}\Delta(m,n)$ given by $x\vee_{i}y=x-\epsilon_{i}\partial_{i}x+y.$ We call $x\operatorname{\bigtriangledown}_{i}y$ a filler and $x\vee_{i}y$ a pasting.
