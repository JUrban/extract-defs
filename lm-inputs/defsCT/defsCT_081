Definition 9.4. Let ${\mathfrak{E}}$ be a $k$-linear exact category. Let $\{P_{i}\}_{i\in{\mathbb{Z}}}$ be a sequence of objects of $\mathfrak{E}.$ We say that the sequence $\{P_{i}\}_{i\in{\mathbb{Z}}}$ is ample in $\mathfrak{E}$ if there is an exact embedding $\mathfrak{E}\subset\mathfrak{A}$ in an abelian category $\mathfrak{A}$ such that the condition (EPI) holds and $\{P_{i}\}_{i\in{\mathbb{Z}}}$ is ample in $\mathfrak{A}.$
Definition 8.1. Let ${\mathcal{T}}$ be a triangulated category that admits arbitrary direct sums. Let $S\subset{\mathcal{T}}^{c}$ be a set of compact generators of the category ${\mathcal{T}}.$ We say that an object $M\in{\mathcal{T}}$ is compactly approximated if a) there is $m\in{\mathbb{Z}}$ such that for any $Y\in S$ we have $\operatorname{Hom}(Y,M[i])=0$ when $i<m;$ b) for any $k\in{\mathbb{Z}}$ there is a morphism $\varphi_{k}:P_{k}\to M$ from a compact object $P_{k}\in{\mathcal{T}}^{c}$ such that for every $Y\in S$ the canonical map $\operatorname{Hom}(Y,P_{k}[i])\longrightarrow\operatorname{Hom}(Y,M[i])$ is an isomorphism when $i\geq k.$ We denote by ${\mathcal{T}}^{ca}$ the full subcategory of compactly approximated objects.
Definition 1.12. Assume that the direct sum $\bigoplus_{n}X_{n}$ exists in ${\mathcal{T}}.$ The homotopy limit of this sequence ${\underrightarrow{\operatorname{hocolim}}\,}X_{n}\in{\mathcal{T}}$ is by definition given, up to non-canonical isomorphism, by a triangle $\begin{CD}\bigoplus_{n}X_{n}@>{(1,-i_{n})}>{}>\bigoplus_{n}X_{n}@>{}>{}>{% \underrightarrow{\operatorname{hocolim}}\,}X_{n}@>{}>{}>\left(\bigoplus_{n}X_{% n}\right)[1]\end{CD}$
Definition 1.7. Let ${\mathcal{T}}$ be a triangulated category that admits arbitrary direct sums. A set $S\subset{\mathcal{T}}^{c}$ is called a set of compact generators if any object $X\in{\mathcal{T}}$ such that $\operatorname{Hom}(Y,X[n])=0$ for all $Y\in S$ and all $n\in{\mathbb{Z}}$ is a zero object.
Definition 2.2. The category ${\mathcal{T}}$ has a unique enhancement if it has one and for any two enhancements $({\mathcal{B}},\varepsilon)$ and $({\mathcal{B}}^{\prime},\varepsilon^{\prime})$ of ${\mathcal{T}}$ there exists a quasi-functor $\phi:{\mathcal{B}}\to{\mathcal{B}}^{\prime}$ which induces an equivalence ${H^{0}}(\phi):{H^{0}}({\mathcal{B}})\stackrel{{\scriptstyle\sim}}{{% \longrightarrow}}{H^{0}}({\mathcal{B}}^{\prime}).$ In this case the enhancements $({\mathcal{B}},\varepsilon)$ and $({\mathcal{B}}^{\prime},\varepsilon^{\prime})$ are called equivalent.
Definition 1.6. Let ${\mathcal{T}}$ be a category. An object $Y\in{\mathcal{T}}$ is called compact (in ${\mathcal{T}}$) if $\operatorname{Hom}_{{\mathcal{T}}}(Y,-)$ commutes with arbitrary (existing in ${\mathcal{T}}$) direct sums, i.e. for each family of objects $\{X_{i}\}\subset{\mathcal{T}}$ such that $\bigoplus_{i}X_{i}$ exists the canonical map $\bigoplus_{i}\operatorname{Hom}(Y,X_{i}){\longrightarrow}\operatorname{Hom}(Y,% \bigoplus_{i}X_{i})$ is an isomorphism.
Definition 2.1. Let ${\mathcal{T}}$ be a triangulated category. An enhancement of ${\mathcal{T}}$ is a pair $({\mathcal{B}},\varepsilon),$ where ${\mathcal{B}}$ is a pretriangulated DG category and $\varepsilon:{H^{0}}({\mathcal{B}})\stackrel{{\scriptstyle\sim}}{{\to}}{% \mathcal{T}}$ is an equivalence of triangulated categories.
Definition 1.10. Let ${\mathcal{T}}$ be a triangulated category. We say that a set $S\subset{\mathcal{T}}$ is a set of classical generators for ${\mathcal{T}}$ if the category ${\mathcal{T}}$ coincides with the smallest triangulated subcategory of ${\mathcal{T}}$ which contains $S$ and is closed under direct summands.
Definition 7.1. In this case we can define a quotient category $\operatorname{QMod}_{{\mathcal{S}}}({\mathcal{A}}):=\operatorname{Mod}% \operatorname{-}{\mathcal{A}}/{\mathcal{S}}$ as a category with the same objects as $\operatorname{Mod}\operatorname{-}{\mathcal{A}}$ and $\operatorname{Hom}_{\operatorname{QMod}_{{\mathcal{S}}}({\mathcal{A}})}(M,N):=% \underrightarrow{\operatorname{colim}}\,\operatorname{Hom}_{\operatorname{Mod}% \operatorname{-}{\mathcal{A}}}(M^{\prime},N/N^{\prime}),$ where $M^{\prime}$ and $N^{\prime}$ are submodules of $M$ and $N$ such that $M/M^{\prime}$ and $N^{\prime}$ are in ${\mathcal{S}}.$
Definition 9.1. Let ${\mathfrak{A}}$ be a $k$-linear abelian category. Let $\{P_{i}\}_{i\in{\mathbb{Z}}}$ be a sequence of objects of ${\mathfrak{A}}.$ We say that this sequence is ample if for every object $C\in{\mathfrak{A}}$ there exists $N$ such that for all $i<N$ the following conditions hold: a) there is an epimorphism $P_{i}^{\oplus n_{i}}\twoheadrightarrow C$ for some $n_{i}\in{\mathbb{N}};$ b) $\operatorname{Ext}^{j}(P_{i},C)=0$ for any $j\neq 0;$ c) $\operatorname{Hom}(C,P_{i})=0$.
Definition 2.3. Enhancements $({\mathcal{B}},\varepsilon)$ and $({\mathcal{B}}^{\prime},\varepsilon^{\prime})$ of ${\mathcal{T}}$ are called strong equivalent if there exists a quasi-functor $\phi:{\mathcal{B}}\to{\mathcal{B}}^{\prime}$ such that the functors $\varepsilon^{\prime}\cdot{H^{0}}(\phi)$ and $\varepsilon$ are isomorphic.
Definition 1.13. Let ${\mathcal{T}}$ be a triangulated category with arbitrary direct sums. A strictly full triangulated subcategory ${\mathcal{S}}\subset{\mathcal{T}}$ is called localizing if it is closed under arbitrary direct sums.
Definition 2.3 A (strict) model $M$ of a theory $\Theta$ is a morphism of theories $M\colon\Theta\to\mathit{Set}$ and a morphism $m\colon M\to M^{\prime}$ of models of $\Theta$ is a natural transformation. This forms the category $\mathit{Mod}(\Theta)$ of models of $\Theta$.
Definition 2.10 A parameterized theory $\Theta_{A}$ is a theory $\Theta$ with a distinguished type, called the type of parameters and usually denoted $A$. The 2-category of parameterized theories is the coslice 2-category $\mathbf{T}_{A}=\Pi_{A}\!\!\downarrow\!\!\mathbf{T}_{\mathit{eq}}$ of theories under $\Pi_{A}$. A theory with a parameter $\Theta_{a}$ is a parameterized theory with a distinguished constant of type $A$, called the parameter and usually denoted $a\colon 1\to A$. The 2-category of theories with a parameter is the coslice 2-category $\mathbf{T}_{a}=\Pi_{a}\!\!\downarrow\!\!\mathbf{T}_{\mathit{eq}}$ of theories under $\Pi_{a}$.
Definition 3.11 The natural transformation $J\colon H\Rightarrow U^{\prime}\circ F^{\prime}_{\mathit{par}}\colon\mathbf{T}% _{\mathit{dec}}\to\mathbf{T}_{\mathit{eq}}$ in theorem 3.10 is called the parameter passing natural transformation.
Definition 3.1 The functor $F_{\mathit{par}}:\mathbf{T}_{\mathit{dec}}\to\mathbf{T}_{A}$ defined above is called the parameterization functor.
Definition 2.1 The category $\mathbf{T}_{\mathit{eq}}$ of equational theories is made of the categories with chosen finite products together with the functors which preserve the chosen finite products. In addition, $\mathbf{T}_{\mathit{eq}}$ can be seen as a 2-category with the natural transformations as 2-cells.
Definition 3.6 For each decorated theory $\Theta$ with pure subcategory $\Theta_{0}$, let $\Theta_{A}=F_{\mathit{par}}(\Theta)$ and $\theta_{A}\colon\Theta_{A}\to\Theta$ as in proposition 3.3, and let $\Theta_{a}$ and $j_{A}\colon\Theta_{A}\to\Theta_{a}$ as in definition 3.5. Then $j\colon\Theta\to\Theta_{a}$ is the morphism under $\Theta_{0}$ which maps each type $X$ to $X$ and each term $f\colon X\to Y$ to $f^{\prime}\circ(a\times\mathit{id}_{X})\colon X\to Y$. And $t\colon j\circ\theta_{A}\Rightarrow j_{A}$ is the natural transformation under $\Theta_{0}$ such that $t_{A}=a\colon 1\to A$.
Definition 2.11 A decorated theory is made of a theory $\Theta$ with a wide subtheory $\Theta_{0}$ called the pure subtheory of $\Theta$. A morphism of decorated theories is a morphism of theories $\theta\colon\Theta\to\Theta^{\prime}$ which maps the pure part of $\Theta$ to the pure part of $\Theta^{\prime}$. This forms the category $\mathbf{T}_{\mathit{dec}}$ of decorated theories.
Definition 2.4 The category $\mathbf{S}_{\mathit{eq}}$ of equational specifications is the category of finite product sketches. With (generalized) natural transformations as 2-cells, $\mathbf{S}_{\mathit{eq}}$ can be seen as a 2-category.
Definition 3.5 Let $\gamma_{A}\colon\Pi_{A}\to\Theta_{A}$ be a parameterized theory. The theory with parameter extending $\gamma_{A}$ is $\gamma_{a}\colon\Pi_{a}\to\Theta_{a}$ given by the pushout of $\gamma_{A}$ and $i_{A}$: $\xymatrix{\ar@{}[rd]|{{\scriptstyle[P.O.]}}\Pi_{A}\ar[d]_{i_{A}}\ar[r]^{\gamma% _{A}}&\Theta_{A}\ar[d]^{j_{A}}\\ \Pi_{a}\ar[r]^{\gamma_{a}}&\Theta_{a}\\ }$
Definition. The graph $Z$. The nonattracting subgraph $Z$ of $G$ is defined as follows. Each stratum $H$ is contained either in $Z$ or in $G\setminus Z$. If $H_{i}$ is an irreducible stratum then $H_{i}\subset G\setminus Z$ if some (every) edge of $H_{i}$ is weakly attracted to $\Lambda$, which holds if and only if for some (every) edge $E_{i}$ of $H_{i}$ there exists $k\geq 0$ so that some term in the complete splitting of $f^{k}_{\#}(E_{i})$ is an edge in $H_{r}$. If $H_{i}$ is a zero stratum enveloped by an EG stratum $H_{s}$ then $H_{i}\subset Z$ if and only if $H_{s}\subset Z$.
Definition 2.11. CT — Completely split improved relative train track map. Given a relative train track map $f\colon G\to G$ and an $f$-invariant filtration $\emptyset=G_{0}\subset G_{1}\subset\cdots\subset G_{N}=G$ we say that $f$ is a CT if $f$ satisfies the following properties: (1) (Rotationless) Each principal vertex is fixed by $f$ and each periodic direction at a principal vertex is fixed by $Df$. (2) (Completely Split) For each edge $E$ in each irreducible stratum, the path $f(E)$ is completely split. For each taken connecting path $\sigma$ in each zero stratum, the path $f_{\#}(\sigma)$ is completely split. (3) (Filtration) The filtration $\emptyset=G_{0}\subset G_{1}\subset\cdots\subset G_{N}=G$ is reduced. For each $i$ there exists $j\leq i$ such that $G_{i}=\operatorname{core}(G_{j})$. (4) (Vertices) The endpoints of all indivisible Nielsen paths are vertices. The terminal endpoint of each nonfixed NEG edge is principal. (5) (Periodic Edges) Each periodic edge is fixed and each endpoint of a fixed edge is principal. If $E=H_{r}$ is a fixed edge and $E$ is not a loop then $G_{r-1}$ is a core graph and both ends of $E$ are contained in $G_{r-1}$. (6) (Zero Strata) Each zero stratum $H_{i}$ is enveloped by some EG stratum $H_{r}$, each edge in $H_{i}$ is $r$-taken, and each vertex in $H_{i}$ is contained in $H_{r}$ and has link contained in $H_{i}\cup H_{r}$. (7) (Linear Edges) For each linear edge $E_{i}$ there exists a closed root-free Nielsen path $w_{i}$ such that $f(E_{i})=E_{i}w_{i}^{d_{i}}$ for some $d_{i}\neq 0$. If $E_{i},E_{j}$ are distinct linear edges, and if the closed path $w_{i}$ is freely homotopic to the closed path $w_{j}$ or its inverse, then $w_{i}=w_{j}$ and $d_{i}\neq d_{j}$. (8) (NEG Nielsen Paths) If $H_{i}=\{E_{i}\}$ is an NEG stratum and $\sigma$ is an indivisible Nielsen path of height $i$ then $E_{i}$ is linear and, with $w_{i}$ as in (Linear Edges), there exists $k\neq 0$ such that $\sigma=E_{i}w^{k}_{i}\overline{E}_{i}$. (9) (EG Nielsen Paths) If $H_{r}$ is EG, if $\rho$ is an indivisible Nielsen path of height $r$, and if $G^{0}_{r}$ is the component of $G_{r}$ containing $H_{r}$, then there exists a map $f_{r}\colon G^{0}_{r}\to\Gamma^{1}$ which is a composition of proper extended folds defined by iteratively folding $\rho$, and a map $f_{r-1}\colon\Gamma^{1}\to\Gamma^{2}$ which is a composition of folds involving only edges of height $\leq r-1$, and a homeomorphism $\theta\colon\Gamma^{2}\to G^{0}_{r}$, such that $f\bigm{|}G^{0}_{r}$ is homotopic rel vertices to $\theta\circ f_{r-1}\circ f_{r}$.
Definition 7.1. Suppose that $f\colon G_{1}\to G_{2}$ is a homotopy equivalence and that $\beta$ is a path. Choose lifts $\tilde{f}:\tilde{G}_{1}\to\tilde{G}_{2}$ and $\tilde{\beta}\subset\tilde{G}_{1}$ to the universal covers. Define $\tilde{f}_{\#\#}(\tilde{\beta})\subset\tilde{f}_{\#}(\beta)\subset\tilde{G}_{2}$ to be the intersection of all paths $\tilde{f}_{\#}(\tilde{\gamma})$ as $\gamma$ ranges over all paths in $\tilde{G}_{1}$ that contain $\tilde{\beta}$ as a subpath and define $f_{\#\#}(\beta)\subset G_{2}$ to be the projected image of $\tilde{f}_{\#\#}(\tilde{\beta})$. Since $\tilde{f}_{\#\#}(\tilde{\beta})$ depends equivariantly on the choices of $\tilde{f}$ and $\tilde{\beta}$, it easily follows that $f_{\#\#}(\beta)$ does not depend on the choice of lifts $\tilde{f}$ and $\tilde{\beta}$. The bounded cancellation lemma implies that there is a uniform bound to the length of the initial and terminal segments that are removed from $f_{\#}(\beta)$ to form $f_{\#\#}(\beta)$.
Definition. The path set $\langle Z,\hat{\rho}_{r}\rangle$. Let $\langle Z,\hat{\rho}_{r}\rangle$ denote those elements of $\widehat{\mathcal{B}}(G)$ — lines, rays, circuits, and finite paths in $G$ — that decompose into a concatenation of subpaths, each of which is either an edge in $Z$, the path $\hat{\rho}_{r}$ or its inverse $\hat{\rho}_{r}^{-1}$.
Definition 3.1. A line $\gamma$ is a singular line for $\phi$ if there exists $\Phi\in P(\phi)$ and a lift $\tilde{\gamma}$ of $\gamma$ whose endpoints are contained in $\operatorname{Fix}_{+}(\widehat{\Phi})\subset\partial F_{n}$. The set of singular lines of $\phi$ is denoted $S_{\phi}$.
Definition. The subgroup system $\mathcal{A}_{\text{na}}(\Lambda)$. If $\hat{\rho}_{r}$ is the trivial path, define $K=Z$ and $h:K\to G$ to be the inclusion. Otherwise, define $K$ to be the graph obtained from the disjoint union of $Z$ and an edge $E_{\rho}$ representing the domain of the map $\rho$, with identifications as follows. If the initial [resp. terminal] endpoint of $\rho$ is contained in $Z$ then identify the initial [resp. terminal] endpoint of $E_{\rho}$ with the initial [resp. terminal] endpoint of $\rho$. If $\rho_{r}$ forms a loop and the basepoint of this loop is not contained in $Z$ then identify the endpoints of $E_{r}$ (these points are already identified if the basepoint is contained in $Z$). Define $h:K\to G$ to be the inclusion on $Z$ and to be the map $\rho$ on $E_{\rho}$. By Fact 2.36 item (1) the first and last edges of $\rho_{r}$ are distinct edges in $H_{r}$, and since no edge of $H_{r}$ is in $Z$ it follows that the map $h$ is an immersion. The restriction of $h$ to each component of $K$ therefore induces an injection on the level of fundamental groups. Define $\mathcal{A}_{\text{na}}(\Lambda)$, the nonattracting subgroup system, to be the subgroup system determined by the images of the fundamental group injections induced by the immersion $h\colon K\to G$, over all noncontractible components of $K$.
Definition 2.10. Complete Splittings. A splitting $\sigma=\sigma_{1}\cdot\ldots\cdot\sigma_{k}$ is called a complete splitting if each term $\sigma_{i}$ satisfies one of the following: $\sigma_{i}$ is an edge in an irreducible stratum; $\sigma_{i}$ is an indivisible Nielsen path; $\sigma_{i}$ is an exceptional path; there is a zero stratum $H_{j}$ such that $\sigma_{i}$ is a maximal subpath of $\sigma$ in $H_{j}$, and $\sigma_{i}$ is taken. A path is said to be completely split if it has a complete splitting.
Definitions 5.1. The graph $Z$, the path $\hat{\rho}_{r}$, the path set $\langle Z,\hat{\rho}_{r}\rangle$, the subgroup system $\mathcal{A}_{\text{na}}(\Lambda)$, and its geometric model. Suppose that $f:G\to G$ is a CT representing $\phi\in\mathsf{Out}(F_{n})$ and that $\Lambda\in\mathcal{L}(\phi)$ corresponds to the EG stratum $H_{r}\subset G$. We shall define the nonattracting subgraph $Z$ of $G$, a path $\hat{\rho}_{r}$, and a graph immersion $h\colon K\to G$ which can be thought of as the union of the inclusion map $Z\hookrightarrow G$ and the path $\hat{\rho}_{r}$. We then define the subgroup system $\mathcal{A}_{\text{na}}(\Lambda)$ using the induced fundamental group injection on each component of $K$. We also define a groupoid of paths $\langle Z,\hat{\rho}_{r}\rangle$, consisting of all concatenations whose terms are edges of $Z$ and copies of the path $\hat{\rho}_{r}$ or its inverse.
Definition 2.9. Relative train track map. Given $\phi\in\mathsf{Out}(F_{n})$ and a topological representative $f\colon G\to G$ with invariant filtration $G_{0}\subset G_{1}\subset\cdots\subset G_{k}=G$, we say that $f$ is a relative train track if for each EG stratum $H_{r}$ the following hold: RTT-(i) $Df$ maps the set of directions of height $r$ to itself. In particular, each turn consisting of a direction of height $r$ and one of height $<r$ is legal. RTT-(ii) For each connecting path $\gamma$ of $H_{r}$, $f_{\#}(\gamma)$ is a connecting path of $H_{r}$. RTT-(iii) For each $r$-legal path $\alpha$, the path $f_{\#}(\alpha)$ is $r$-legal.
Definition. The path $\hat{\rho}_{r}$. If there is an indivisible Nielsen path $\rho_{r}$ of height $r$ then it is unique and we define $\hat{\rho}_{r}=\rho_{r}$. If there is no indivisible Nielsen path of height $r$, then by convention we choose a vertex of $H_{r}$, and define $\hat{\rho}_{r}$ to be the trivial path at that vertex.
Definition 2.35. Geometric Strata. Suppose that $f:G\to G$ is a CT representing a rotationless $\phi\in\mathsf{Out}(F_{n})$ and that $H_{r}\subset G$ is an EG stratum. Following Definition 5.1.4 and Section 5.3 of [BFH00] we say that $H_{r}$ is a geometric stratum if the map $f\bigm{|}G_{r}$ has a geometric model, consisting of a compact $2$-complex $Y$, an embedding $G_{r}\hookrightarrow Y$, a deformation retraction $d\colon Y\to G_{r}$, and a homotopy equivalence $h\colon Y\to Y$, with the following properties: (1) There exists $m\geq 0$, a compact, connected, hyperbolic surface $S$ with totally geodesic boundary components $\partial S=\bigcup_{0\leq i\leq m}\partial_{i}S$, a collection of annuli $\mathcal{A}=\bigcup_{1\leq i\leq m}\,\mathcal{A}_{i}$, and a collection of circuits $\alpha_{i}$ in $G_{r-1}$, $1\leq i\leq m$, such that $Y$ is obtained from the disjoint union of $S$, $\mathcal{A}_{1},\ldots,\mathcal{A}_{m}$ and $G_{r-1}$ by attaching one component of $\partial\mathcal{A}_{i}$ to $\partial_{i}S$ and the other to $\alpha_{i}$. (See below under the heading “A metric on $Y$” for a further restriction on the hyperbolic structure of $S$.) (2) $h\colon Y\to Y$ represents $\phi$ in the sense that $f\circ d$ and $d\circ h$ are homotopic. (3) $h\bigm{|}G_{r-1}=f\bigm{|}G_{r-1}$ (4) The map $\Psi=h\bigm{|}S\colon S\to S$ is a homeomorphism whose mapping class $\psi\in\operatorname{\mathcal{MCG}}(S)$ is pseudo-Anosov. Let $\Lambda^{s},\Lambda^{u}\subset S$ denote the stable and unstable geodesic laminations of $\psi$. Let $D\colon S\to G$ be the composition $S\subset Y\xrightarrow{d}G_{r}\subset G$, inducing a monomorphism $D_{*}\colon\pi_{1}S\to\pi_{1}G\approx F_{n}$ that is well-defined up to inner automorphism of $F_{n}$. Let $[\partial_{i}S]$ denote the conjugacy class in $F_{n}$ of $D_{*}(\partial_{i}S)$, and let $[\pi_{1}(S)]$ denote the conjugacy class of the subgroup $D_{*}(\pi_{1}(S))$. Items (1)—(4) constitute Definition 5.1.4 of [BFH00], but for our definition we incorporate one more item which is verified in the proof of Proposition 5.3.1, where the items (1)—(4) are also verified; see specifically the bottom of page 573, the diagram at the top of page 574, and the proof beginning on page 578. (5) With respect to a parameterization $\rho\colon[0,1]\to G_{r}$, there exists a homeomorphism $k\colon C_{\rho}\to Y$ where $C_{\rho}$ is the mapping cyclinder $C_{\rho}=\bigl{[}([0,1]\times[0,1])\coprod G_{r}\bigr{]}\biggm{/}(t,0)\sim\rho% (t)$ such that $k$ takes $(0\times[0,1])\cup([0,1]\times 1)\cup(1\times[0,1])$ to $\partial_{0}S$, $k$ restricts to the identity on $G_{r}$, and there exists a deformation retraction $d^{\prime}\colon[0,1]\times[0,1]\to[0,1]\times 0$ such that $kd^{\prime}=dk$. By Fact 2.36 (3), the base point of $\rho_{r}$ is not contained in $G_{r-1}$, and combining with (5) we obtain the following as well: (6) $G_{r}\cap\partial_{0}S$ is a single point $v_{S}$, it is the base point of the closed Nielsen path $\rho_{r}$, $d(v_{S})=v_{S}$, and there is a parameterization $\rho_{S}$ of $\partial_{0}S$ based at $v_{S}$ such that $d\circ\rho_{S}=\rho_{r}$. Item (6) will be used in Section 5.1, in the definition of the geometric model for $\mathcal{A}_{\text{na}}\Lambda$.
Definition 2. The equational theory of monoids $\mathfrak{M}$ has one object $1$ and two generators $\mu:2\to 1$ and $\eta:0\to 1$ subject to the three relations $\begin{array}[]{c}\mu\circ(\mu\otimes\mathrm{id}_{1})\quad=\quad\mu\circ(% \mathrm{id}_{1}\otimes\mu)\\ \mu\circ(\eta\otimes\mathrm{id}_{1})\quad=\quad\mathrm{id}_{1}\quad=\quad\mu% \circ(\mathrm{id}_{1}\otimes\eta)\end{array}\vspace{\reduce}\vspace{-1mm}$
Definition 8. A game $A=(M_{A},\lambda_{A},\leq_{A})$ consists of a set of moves $M_{A}$, a polarization function $\lambda_{A}$ from $M_{A}$ to $\{-1,+1\}$ which to every move $m$ associates its polarity, and a well-founded partial order $\leq_{A}$ on moves, called causality or justification. A move $m$ is said to be a Proponent move when $\lambda_{A}(m)=+1$ and an Opponent move otherwise.
Definition 9. A strategy $\sigma$ on a game $A$ is a partial order $\leq_{\sigma}$ on the moves of $A$ which satisfies the two following properties: 1. polarity: for every pair of moves $m,n\in M_{A}$ such that $m<_{\sigma}n$, we have $\lambda_{A}(m)=-1\text{ and }\lambda_{A}(n)=+1$. 2. acyclicity: the partial order $\leq_{\sigma}$ is compatible with the partial order of the game, in the sense that the transitive closure of their union is still a partial order (i.e. is acyclic).
Definition 1. A monoidal equational theory is a 7-uple $\mathfrak{E}=(E_{1},s_{1},t_{1},E_{2},s_{2},t_{2},E_{3})\vspace{\reduce}% \vspace{-1mm}$ where $(E_{1},s_{1},t_{1},E_{2})$ is a signature together with a set $E_{3}$ of relations and two morphisms $s_{2},t_{2}:E_{3}\to E_{2}^{*}$, as pictured in the diagram $\vbox{\xymatrix@C=7ex@R=7ex{ E_1\ar[d]_{i_1}&\ar@<-0.7ex>[dl]_{s_1}\ar@<0.7ex>[dl]^{t_1}E_2\ar[d]_{i_2}&\ar% @<-0.7ex>[dl]_{s_2}\ar@<0.7ex>[dl]^{t_2}E_3\\ E_1^*&\ar@<-0.7ex>[l]_{\overline{s_1}}\ar@<0.7ex>[l]^{\overline{t_1}}E_2^*\\ }}\vspace{\reduce}\vspace{-1mm}$ such that $\overline{s_{1}}\circ s_{2}=\overline{s_{1}}\circ t_{2}$ and $\overline{t_{1}}\circ s_{2}=\overline{t_{1}}\circ t_{2}$.
Definition 10. The equational theory of strategies is the equational theory $\mathfrak{G}$ with two atomic types $O$ and $P$ and thirteen generators depicted in Figure 1 such that • the Opponent structure $(O,\mu^{O},\eta^{O},\delta^{O},\varepsilon^{O},\gamma^{O})\vspace{\reduce}% \vspace{-1mm}$ is a bicommutative qualitative bialgebra, • the Proponent structure $(P,\mu^{P},\eta^{P},\delta^{P},\varepsilon^{P},\gamma^{P})$, as well as the morphism $\gamma^{OP}$, are deduced from the Opponent structure (12) by composition with the duality morphisms $\eta^{OP}$ and $\varepsilon^{OP}$ (for example $\eta^{P}=(\varepsilon^{O}\varolessthan\mathrm{id}_{P})\circ\eta^{OP}$).
Definition 9. A stochastic process is a $\mathcal{P}$ map representing a probability measure on the function space $Y^{X}$. A parameterized stochastic process is a $\mathcal{P}$ map representing a family of stochastic processes parameterized by $Z$.
Definition 13. A Gaussian process on $Y^{X}$ is a probability measure $P$ on the function space $Y^{X}$, denoted $P\sim\mathcal{G}\mathcal{P}(m,k)$, such that for all finite subsets $X_{0}$ of $X$ the push forward probability measure $P\iota^{-1}$ is a (multivariate) Gaussian distribution denoted $P\iota^{-1}\sim\mathcal{N}(m|_{X_{0}},k|_{X_{0}})$.
Definition 18. Let $X$ be any category. A stochastic process is a point in the category $\mathcal{P}^{X}$, i.e., a $\mathcal{P}^{X}$ arrow $\eta:\mathbf{1}\rightarrow\mathcal{F}$ for some $\mathcal{F}\in_{ob}\mathcal{P}^{X}$.25In any category with a terminal object $1$ an arrow whose domain is $1$ is called a point. So an arrow $x:1\rightarrow X$ is called a point of $X$ whereas $f:X\rightarrow Y$ is sometimes referred to as a generalized element to emphasize that it “varies” over the domain. It is constructive to consider what this means in the category of Sets and why the terminology is meaningful.
Definition 17. A Markov transformation is a functor $\mathcal{F}:(T,\leq)\rightarrow\mathcal{P}$.
Definition 10. Given a measurable space $(X,\Sigma_{X})$, we can define an equivalence relation on $X$ where $x\sim y$ if $x\in A\Leftrightarrow y\in A$ for all $A\in\Sigma_{X}$. We call an equivalence class of this relation an atom of $X$. For an arbitrary set $A\subset X$, we say that $A$ is $\bullet$ separated if for any two points $x,y\in A$, there is some $B\in\Sigma_{X}$ with $x\in B$ and $y\notin B$ $\bullet$ unseparated if $A$ is contained in some atom of $X$.
Definition 8.14. We also have the hTVZ, and fhTVZ topologies on ${\text{\sf{A}}}={\text{\sf{Afnd}}}^{op}_{k}$ and $\\ ttA=({\text{\sf{Afnd}}}^{op}_{k})^{\leq 1}$ defined in 4.73, and 4.71 and called the homotopy Zariski, and formal homotopy Zariski topologies
Definition 6.13. The symmetric monoidal structure which we will use assigns to two objects $V,W\in{\text{\sf{Ban}}}_{k}$ their projective tensor product. In the Archimedean case it is given (see Chapter 2 of [44]) by the completion of the algebraic tensor product $V\otimes_{k}W$ with respect to the norm $\|u\|=\inf\{\sum_{i=1}^{n}\|v_{i}\|\|w_{i}\|\ \ |\ \ u=\sum_{i=1}^{n}v_{i}% \otimes w_{i}\}.$ In the non-Archimedean case it is given (see Section 3.2 of [20]) by the completion of the algebraic tensor product $V\otimes_{k}W$ with respect to the norm $\|u\|=\inf\{\max\{\|v_{i}\|\|w_{i}\|\ \ i=1\dots n\ \ \}\ \ |\ \ u=\sum_{i=1}^% {n}v_{i}\otimes w_{i}\}.$ It will be denoted $V\widehat{\otimes}_{k}W.$
Definition 3.1. The category of presheaves of sets on ${\text{\sf{Aff}}}({\text{\sf{C}}})$ is the category whose objects are contravariant functors ${\text{\sf{Aff}}}({\text{\sf{C}}})\to{\text{\sf{Set}}}$ and whose morphisms are natural transformations. It will be denoted ${\text{\sf{Pr}}}({\text{\sf{Aff}}}({\text{\sf{C}}}))$. Given a Grothendieck topology $T$ on the category ${\text{\sf{Aff}}}({\text{\sf{C}}})$ we will often consider the full subcategories of sheaves of sets ${\text{\sf{Pr}}}({\text{\sf{Aff}}}({\text{\sf{C}}})^{T})\subset{\text{\sf{Pr}}% }({\text{\sf{Aff}}}({\text{\sf{C}}}))$, where ${\text{\sf{Aff}}}({\text{\sf{C}}})^{T}$ is the site consisting of the underlying category ${\text{\sf{Aff}}}({\text{\sf{C}}})$ along with the Grothendieck topology $T$.
Definition 5.4. An Archimedean semi-normed space over an Archimedean field $k$ is a $k$-module $V$ together with a map $\|\|:V\to\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$ which satisfies • $\|cv\|=|c|\|v\|$ • $\|v+w\|\leq\|v\|+\|w\|$ for all $c\in k$ and $v,w\in V$. An Archimedean normed space is an Archimedean semi-normed space such that $\|v\|=0$ if and only if $v=0$.
Definition 3.37. A morphism $f:F\to G$ in ${\text{\sf{Pr}}}({\text{\sf{Aff}}}(\text{\sf{C}}))$ is flat if for every affine scheme $X$ and every morphism $X\to G$ and every flat morphism $W\to X\times_{G}F$ the composition $W\to X\times_{G}F\to X$ is flat.
Definition 7.1. For any finite ordered set of positive real numbers $r=(r_{1},\dots,r_{n})$, let $k\{r_{1}^{-1}x_{1},\dots,r_{n}^{-1}x_{n}\}\in{\text{\sf{Comm}}}({\text{\sf{Ban% }}}_{k})$ be the completion of $k[x_{1},\dots,x_{n}]$ with respect to the norm $\|\sum_{I\in\mathbb{Z}^{n}_{\geq 0}}a_{I}x^{I}\|_{r}=\text{max}_{I}\{|a_{I}|r^% {I}\}$ where for each $I=(i_{1},\dots,i_{n})\in\mathbb{Z}^{n}_{\geq 0}$, $a_{I}=a_{i_{1},\dots,i_{n}}$ and $x^{I}=x^{i_{1}}_{1}\cdots x^{i_{n}}_{n}$.
Definition 4.19. Let E be a quasi-abelian category. A strictly generating set of E is a subset $\mathcal{G}$ of $Ob({\text{\sf{E}}})$ such that for any monomorphism $m:S\to E$ of E which is not an isomorphism, there is a morphism $G\to E$ with $G\in\mathcal{G}$ which does not factor through $m$.
Definition 3.18. The morphism $\operatorname{spec}(B)\to\operatorname{spec}(A)$ is called a Zariski open immersion if the corresponding morphism $A\to B$ in ${\text{\sf{Comm}}}({\text{\sf{C}}})$ is a flat epimorphism of finite presentation (defined in Remark 3.7 and Definitions 3.5 and 3.10).
