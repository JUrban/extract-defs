Definition 1.1. Let $\mathcal{E}$ be a category. A pseudomonoidal structure on $\mathcal{E}$ consists of the following data: • a collection of products $\mu_{n}:\mathcal{E}^{n}\to\mathcal{E}$ for $n\geq 2$; (To be able to state the conditions below more easily, we also define $\mu_{1}$ to be the identity functor on $\mathcal{E}$.) • a unit object $I\in\mathcal{E}$; • natural unicity morphisms $\iota_{n,k}:\mu_{n}(X_{1},\dots,X_{n})\to\mu_{n+1}(X_{1},\dots,X_{k},I,X_{k+1}% ,\dots,X_{n})$ for $n\geq 1$ and $0\leq k\leq n$, that insert the unit object $I$ after the $k$th position of the $n$-fold ‘product’. (Note that the $n=1$ case gives us maps $X\to\mu_{2}(X,I)$ and $X\to\mu_{2}(I,X)$;) • natural associativity morphisms $\alpha_{n,l,r}:\mu_{n}(X_{1},\dots,X_{n})\to\mu_{n-r+1}(X_{1},\dots,X_{l},\mu_% {r}(X_{l+1},\dots,X_{l+r}),X_{l+r+1},\dots,X_{n})$ for $0\leq l<l+r\leq n$, that collect the $r$ terms starting after the $l$th into a separate product; satisfying the following conditions: (1) the associativity morphisms commute with the unicity morphisms: (a) for $k\leq l$, the following diagram of natural transformations commutes: $\diagram\dgARROWLENGTH=3.5em\node{\scriptstyle\mu_{n}(X_{1},\dots,X_{n})}% \arrow{e,t}{\alpha_{n,l,r}}\arrow{s,l}{\iota_{n,k}}\node{\scriptstyle\mu_{n-r+% 1}(X_{1},\dots,\mu_{r}(X_{l+1},\dots,X_{l+r}),\dots,X_{n})}\arrow{s,r}{\iota_{% n-r+1,k}}\\ \node{\scriptstyle\mu_{n+1}(X_{1},\dots,X_{k},I,X_{k+1},\dots,X_{n})}\arrow{r,% b}{\alpha_{n+1,l+1,r}}\node{\scriptstyle\mu_{n-r+2}(X_{1},\dots,X_{k},I,X_{k+1% },\dots,\mu_{r}(X_{l+1},\dots,X_{l+r}),\dots,X_{n})}$ (b) for $l\leq k\leq l+r$, the following diagram commutes $\diagram\dgARROWLENGTH=3.5em\node{\scriptstyle\mu_{n}(X_{1},\dots,X_{n})}% \arrow{e,t}{\alpha_{n,l,r}}\arrow{s,l}{\iota_{n,k}}\node{\scriptstyle\mu_{n-r+% 1}(X_{1},\dots,\mu_{r}(X_{l+1},\dots,X_{l+r}),\dots,X_{n})}\arrow{s,r}{\mu_{n-% r+1}(X_{1},\dots,X_{l},\iota_{r,k-l},X_{l+r+1},\dots,X_{n})}\\ \node{\scriptstyle\mu_{n+1}(X_{1},\dots,X_{k},I,X_{k+1},\dots,X_{n})}\arrow{r,% b}{\alpha_{n+1,l,r+1}}\node{\scriptstyle\mu_{n-r+1}(X_{1},\dots,\mu_{r+1}(X_{l% +1},\dots,X_{k},I,X_{k+1},\dots,X_{l+r}),\dots,X_{n})}$ (c) for $l+r\leq k$ we have $\diagram\node{\scriptstyle\mu_{n}(X_{1},\dots,X_{n})}\arrow{e,t}{\alpha_{n,l,r% }}\arrow{s,l}{\iota_{n,k}}\node{\scriptstyle\mu_{n-r+1}(X_{1},\dots,\mu_{r}(X_% {l+1},\dots,X_{l+r}),\dots,X_{n})}\arrow{s,r}{\iota_{n-r+1,k-r+1}}\\ \node{\scriptstyle\mu_{n+1}(X_{1},\dots,X_{k},I,X_{k+1},\dots,X_{n})}\arrow{r,% b}{\alpha_{n+1,l,r}}\node{\scriptstyle\mu_{n-r+2}(X_{1},\dots,\mu_{r}(X_{l+1},% \dots,X_{l+r}),\dots,X_{k},I,X_{k+1}\dots,X_{n})}$ (2) the associativity morphisms commute with each other: (a) for $l+s\leq k$ we have $\diagram\dgARROWLENGTH=3.5em\node{\scriptstyle\mu_{n}(X_{1},\dots,X_{n})}% \arrow{e,t}{\alpha_{n,l,s}}\arrow{s,l}{\alpha_{n,k,r}}\node{\scriptstyle\mu_{n% -s+1}(X_{1},\dots,\mu_{s}(X_{l+1},\dots,X_{l+s}),\dots,X_{n})}\arrow{s,r}{% \alpha_{n-s+1,k-s+1,r}}\\ \node{\scriptstyle\mu_{n-r+1}(X_{1},\dots,\mu_{r}(X_{k+1},\dots,X_{k+r}),\dots% ,X_{n})}\arrow{e,b}{\alpha_{n-r+1,l,s}}\node{\scriptstyle\mu_{n-r-s+2}(X_{1},% \dots,\mu_{s}(X_{l+1},\dots,X_{l+s}),\dots,\mu_{r}(X_{k+1},\dots,X_{k+r}),% \dots,X_{n})}$ (b) for $l\leq k<k+r\leq l+s$ we have $\diagram\dgARROWLENGTH=4em\node{\scriptstyle\mu_{n}(X_{1},\dots,X_{n})}\arrow{% e,t}{\alpha_{n,l,s}}\arrow{s,l}{\alpha_{n,k,r}}\node{\scriptstyle\mu_{n-s+1}(X% _{1},\dots,\mu_{s}(X_{l+1},\dots,X_{l+s}),\dots,X_{n})}\arrow{s,l}{\mu_{n-s+1}% (X_{1},\dots,X_{l},\alpha_{s,k-l,r},X_{l+s+1},\dots,X_{n})}\\ \node{\scriptstyle\mu_{n-r+1}(X_{1},\dots,\mu_{r}(X_{k+1},\dots,X_{k+r}),\dots% ,X_{n})}\arrow{e,b}{\alpha_{n-r+1,l,s-r+1}}\node{\scriptstyle\mu_{n-s+1}(X_{1}% ,\dots,\mu_{s-r+1}(X_{l+1},\dots,\mu_{r}(X_{k+1},\dots,X_{k+r}),\dots,X_{l+s})% ,\dots,X_{n})}$ (3) the unicity morphisms commute with each other: for $l\leq k$ we have $\diagram\node{\scriptstyle\mu_{n}(X_{1},\dots,X_{n})}\arrow{e,t}{\iota_{n,l}}% \arrow{s,l}{\iota_{n,k}}\node{\scriptstyle\mu_{n+1}(X_{1},\dots,X_{l},I,X_{l+1% },\dots,X_{n})}\arrow{s,r}{\iota_{n+1,k+1}}\\ \node{\scriptstyle\mu_{n+1}(X_{1},\dots,X_{k},I,X_{k+1},\dots,X_{n})}\arrow{e,% b}{\iota_{n+1,l}}\node{\scriptstyle\mu_{n+1}(X_{1},\dots,X_{l},I,X_{l+1},\dots% ,X_{k},I,X_{k+1},\dots,X_{n})}$ These conditions are the pseudomonoidal analogue of the coherence axioms connecting the unit and associativity isomorphisms in a monoidal category.
Definition 3.1. Let $(\mu_{n},\iota_{n,k},\alpha_{n,k,r})$ be a pseudomonoidal structure on the category $\mathcal{E}$. A monoid with respect to this structure consists of an object $M\in\mathcal{E}$, multiplication maps $m_{n}:\mu_{n}(M,\dots,M)\to M$ for each $n\geq 2$ (we also take $m_{1}:M\to M$ to be the identity morphism on $M$), and a unit map $\eta:I\to M$ such that the following conditions hold: (1) the multiplication is ‘unital’ in the sense that, for $n\geq 1$ and $0\leq k\leq n$, the following diagrams commute: $\diagram\node{\mu_{n}(M,\dots,M)}\arrow{s,l}{\iota_{n,k}}\arrow[3]{e,t}{m_{n}}% \node[3]{M}\arrow[2]{s,=}\\ \node{\mu_{n+1}(M,\dots,I,\dots,M)}\arrow{s,l}{\mu_{n+1}(M,\dots,\eta,\dots,M)% }\\ \node{\mu_{n+1}(M,\dots,M)}\arrow[3]{e,b}{m_{n+1}}\node[3]{M}$ (2) the multiplication is ‘associative’ in the sense that, for $n\geq 3$ and $0\leq k<k+r\leq n$, the following diagrams commute: $\diagram\node{\mu_{n}(M,\dots,M)}\arrow{s,l}{\alpha_{n,k,r}}\arrow[3]{e,t}{m_{% n}}\node[3]{M}\arrow[2]{s,=}\\ \node{\mu_{n-r+1}(M,\dots,\mu_{r}(M,\dots,M),\dots,M)}\arrow{s,l}{\mu_{n-r+1}(% M,\dots,m_{r},\dots,M)}\\ \node{\mu_{n-r+1}(M,\dots,M)}\arrow[3]{e,b}{m_{n-r+1}}\node[3]{M}$
Definition 4.1. Let $M$ be a monoid with respect to a pseudomonoidal structure on a category $\mathcal{E}$ with left module $L$ and right module $R$. The two-sided simplicial bar construction on $M$ with coefficients in $R$ and $L$ is the simplicial object $\mathcal{B}_{\bullet}(R,M,L)$ in $\mathcal{E}$ defined as follows: $\mathcal{B}_{n}(R,M,L):=\mu_{n+2}(R,M,\dots,M,L)$ with face map $d_{i}:\mathcal{B}_{n}(R,M,L)\to\mathcal{B}_{n-1}(R,M,L)$ given, for $1\leq i\leq n-1$, by the composite $\dgTEXTARROWLENGTH=3em\begin{split}\displaystyle d_{i}:\mu_{n+2}(R,M,\dots,M,L% )&\displaystyle\arrow{e,t}{\alpha_{n+2,i,2}}\mu_{n+1}(R,M,\dots,\mu_{2}(M,M),% \dots,M,L)\\ &\displaystyle\arrow{e,t}{m_{2}}\mu_{n+1}(R,M,\dots,M,L)\end{split}$ The face map $d_{0}$ is given by $\dgTEXTARROWLENGTH=3em\begin{split}\displaystyle d_{0}:\mu_{n+2}(R,M,\dots,M,L% )&\displaystyle\arrow{e,t}{\alpha_{n+2,0,2}}\mu_{n+1}(\mu_{2}(R,M),M,\dots,M,L% )\\ &\displaystyle\arrow{e,t}{r_{2}}\mu_{n+1}(R,M,\dots,M,L)\end{split}$ using the right action map $r_{2}:\mu_{2}(R,M)\to R$ and the face map $d_{n}$ is given by $\dgTEXTARROWLENGTH=3em\begin{split}\displaystyle d_{n}:\mu_{n+2}(R,M,\dots,M,L% )&\displaystyle\arrow{e,t}{\alpha_{n+2,n,2}}\mu_{n+1}(R,M,\dots,M,\mu_{2}(M,L)% )\\ &\displaystyle\arrow{e,t}{l_{2}}\mu_{n+1}(R,M,\dots,M,L)\end{split}$ using the left action map $l_{2}:\mu_{2}(M,L)\to L$. The degeneracy map $s_{j}:\mathcal{B}_{n}(R,M,L)\to\mathcal{B}_{n+1}(R,M,L)$ is given, for $0\leq j\leq n$, by the composite $\dgTEXTARROWLENGTH=3em\begin{split}\displaystyle s_{j}:\mu_{n+2}(R,M,\dots,M,L% )&\displaystyle\arrow{e,t}{\iota_{n+2,j+1}}\mu_{n+3}(R,M,\dots,I,\dots,M,L)\\ &\displaystyle\arrow{e,t}{\eta}\mu_{n+3}(R,M,\dots,M,\dots,M,L).\end{split}$ The next proposition tells us that this definition does indeed make $\mathcal{B}_{\bullet}(R,M,L)$ into a simplicial object in $\mathcal{E}$.
Definition 2.7. Now let $F_{1},\dots,F_{n}$ be symmetric sequences in the symmetric monoidal category $\mathcal{C}$. The higher composition product is the symmetric sequence $(F_{1}\circ\dots\circ F_{n})$ defined by $(F_{1}\circ\dots\circ F_{n})(A):=\coprod_{T\in\mathsf{L}_{n}(A)}\left(% \bigwedge_{v\in T}F_{l(v)}(J(v))\right).$ The big $\wedge$-product here is taken over all vertices of $T$ that are not leaves. If $v$ is a leaf, the expression $F(J(v))$ does not make sense because $v$ has no incoming edges. A bijection $A\to A^{\prime}$ determines a one-to-one correspondence between $A$-labelled trees and $A^{\prime}$-labelled trees and hence a bijection $L_{n}(A)\to L_{n}(A^{\prime})$. Moreover, it produces a bijection between the vertices of $T$ and the vertices of $T^{\prime}$ whenever $T$ and $T^{\prime}$ correspond. Furthermore, we get bijections $J(v)\to J(v^{\prime})$ when $v$ and $v^{\prime}$ correspond under this bijection. Altogether this allows us to define an isomorphism from $(F_{1}\circ\dots\circ F_{n})(A)$ to $(F_{1}\circ\dots\circ F_{n})(A^{\prime})$ and hence make the higher composition product into a symmetric sequence as claimed.
Definition 2.4. The unit symmetric sequence $I$ in the symmetric monoidal category $\mathcal{C}$ is given by $I(A)=\begin{cases}S&\text{if $|A|=1$};\\ 0&\text{otherwise};\end{cases}$ where $0$ is an initial object in $\mathcal{C}$. The map $I(A)\to I(A^{\prime})$ induced by a bijection $A\to A^{\prime}$ is the identity morphism on $S$ or $0$ as appropriate.
Definition 3.5. Let $M$ be a monoid with respect to a pseudomonoidal structure on the category $\mathcal{E}$. A left $M$-module consists of an object $L\in\mathcal{E}$ and a collection of left action maps $l_{n}:\mu_{n}(M,\dots,M,L)\to L$ for $n\geq 2$ (with $l_{1}:L\to L$ taken to be the identity morphism on $L$), that satisfy the following conditions: (1) the action is unital in the sense that, for $n\geq 1$ and $0\leq k\leq n-1$, the following diagram commutes: $\diagram\node{\mu_{n}(M,\dots,M,L)}\arrow{e,t}{l_{n}}\arrow{s,l}{\iota_{n,k}}% \node{L}\arrow[2]{s,=}\\ \node{\mu_{n+1}(M,\dots,I,\dots,L)}\arrow{s,l}{\mu_{n+1}(M,\dots,\eta,\dots,L)% }\\ \node{\mu_{n+1}(M,\dots,M,L)}\arrow{e,b}{l_{n+1}}\node{L}$ Note in particular the case $n=1$ which says that the composite $L\to\mu_{2}(I,L)\to\mu_{2}(M,L)\to L$ is the identity; (2) the action is associative in the sense that, for $n\geq 3$ and $0\leq k<k+r\leq n-1$, the following diagram commutes: $\diagram\node{\mu_{n}(M,\dots,M,L)}\arrow[3]{e,t}{l_{n}}\arrow{s,l}{\alpha_{n,% k,r}}\node[3]{L}\arrow[2]{s,=}\\ \node{\mu_{n-r+1}(M,\dots,\mu_{r}(M,\dots,M),\dots,L)}\arrow{s,l}{\mu_{n-r+1}(% M,\dots,m_{r},\dots,L)}\\ \node{\mu_{n-r+1}(M,\dots,M,L)}\arrow[3]{e,b}{l_{n-r+1}}\node[3]{L}$ and, for $n\geq 3$ and $0\leq k<k+r=n$, the following diagram commutes: $\diagram\node{\mu_{n}(M,\dots,M,L)}\arrow[3]{e,t}{l_{n}}\arrow{s,l}{\alpha_{n,% k,r}}\node[3]{L}\arrow[2]{s,=}\\ \node{\mu_{n-r+1}(M,\dots,\mu_{r}(M,\dots,L))}\arrow{s,l}{\mu_{n-r+1}(M,\dots,% l_{r})}\\ \node{\mu_{n-r+1}(M,\dots,M,L)}\arrow[3]{e,b}{l_{n-r+1}}\node[3]{L}$ The corresponding notion of right $M$-module consists of an object $R\in\mathcal{E}$ with right action maps $r_{n}:\mu_{n}(R,M\dots,M)$ satisfying similar conditions.
Definition 2.10. The higher products in our pseudomonoidal structure on the category of symmetric sequences are given by these higher composition products: $\mu_{n}(F_{1},\dots,F_{n}):=(F_{1}\circ\dots\circ F_{n}).$ The unit object $I$ is the symmetric sequence described in Definition 2.4.
Definition 2.1. A symmetric sequence in a category $\mathcal{C}$ is a functor $F:\mathsf{FinBij}\to\mathcal{C}$ from the category $\mathsf{FinBij}$, whose objects are finite nonempty sets and whose morphisms are bijections, to $\mathcal{C}$. Denote the category of all symmetric sequences in $\mathcal{C}$ by $\mathcal{C}^{\Sigma}$ (in which morphisms are natural transformations).
Definition 2.6. A tree $T$ is a finite poset satisfying the following conditions: (1) $T$ contains a unique minimal element $r$ (the root); (2) if $u\leq t$ and $v\leq t$ then either $u\leq v$ or $v\leq u$. The graph of the tree $T$ is the graph whose vertices are the elements of the poset $T$ with an edge connecting $t$ and $u$ if $t<u$ and there is no $v$ with $t<v<u$. The two conditions above ensure that the graph of a tree is a tree in the usual sense (that is, it is connected with no cycles). For a finite set $A$, an $A$-labelled tree is a tree $T$ together with a bijection from $A$ to the set of maximal elements (or leaves) of $T$. An isomorphism of $A$-labelled trees is an isomorphism of the underlying trees that respects the labellings. Write $\mathsf{T}(A)$ for the set of isomorphism classes of $A$-labelled trees. The level of a vertex $v$ in a tree $T$ is the number of vertices along the direct path from $v$ to the root, including the endpoints. Thus the root is level $1$ and any path up the tree from the root follows consecutive levels. We write $l(v)$ for the level of the vertex $v$. A tree is $n$-level if and only if every leaf is of level $n+1$ (so the leaves are not counted when determining the level of a tree. A tree is level if it is $n$-level for any $n$, and we write $\mathsf{L}_{n}(A)$ for the subset of $\mathsf{T}(A)$ consisting of isomorphism classes of $n$-level trees. Notice that we can view an $n$-level tree as a sequence of $n-1$ nested partitions of $A$. We will use these trees to define the higher composition products of symmetric sequences. Finally, if $v$ is not a leaf, we denote by $J(v)$ the set of incoming edges to the vertex $v$, that is, the set of vertices $u$ that are minimal with the property that $u>v$.
Definition 3.9. Let $M$ be a monoid with respect to a pseudomonoidal structure on the category $\mathcal{E}$. An augmentation for $M$ is a map $\epsilon:M\to I$ such that the composite $\epsilon\eta:I\to M\to I$ is the identity morphism on $I$ (where $I$ is the unit object for the pseudomonoidal structure).
Definition 2.13. The associativity morphism $\alpha_{n,k,r}$ for our pseudomonoidal structure takes the form $F_{1}\circ\dots\circ F_{n}\to F_{1}\circ\dots\circ(F_{k+1}\circ\dots\circ F_{k% +r})\circ\dots\circ F_{n}.$ At a particular nonempty finite set $A$, this is again a map between coproducts taken over sets of level trees. We can construct it by defining maps $(F_{1},\dots,F_{n})(T)\to(F_{1},\dots,F_{k},(F_{k+1}\circ\dots\circ F_{k+r}),F% _{k+r+1},\dots,F_{n})(T_{k,r})$ for each $T\in\mathsf{L}_{n}(A)$, where $T_{k,r}$ is an $n-r+1$-level tree associated to $T$. We construct $T_{k,r}$ from $T$ by removing the vertices in levels $k+1$ to $k+r-1$. Visually, this collapses those levels so that that level $k$ vertices now have in general more incoming edges than before: $F_{k}$$F_{k+1}\circ\dots\circ F_{k+r}$$F_{k+r}$$F_{k}$$F_{k+r+1}$$F_{k+r+1}$$F_{k+1}$ The factors in the $\wedge$-products on the two sides of (##) that involve the symmetric sequences $F_{1},\dots,F_{k}$ and $F_{k+r+1},\dots,F_{n}$ match up one-to-one. The map (##) will be the identity on those factors. The remaining factors on the left-hand side correspond to vertices of the tree $T$ in levels $k+1$ up to $k+r$. We can partition these vertices according to which level $k+1$ vertex they sit above or are equal to. For a level $k+1$ vertex $v$, write $U_{v}$ for the set of our remaining vertices that are above it. If we add the relevant level $k+r+1$ vertices as leaves, $U_{v}$ becomes an $r$-level tree labelled by the set $J$ of level $k+r+1$ vertices that sit above $v$. On the right-hand side of (##), we have one remaining factor for each of these vertices $v$ of level $k+1$ and this factor is the value of the symmetric sequence $F_{k+1}\circ\dots\circ F_{k+r}$ on the set $J$. The following diagram shows how these match up. $U_{v}$$k+r+1$$k+r$$k+1$$v$$F_{k+r+1}$$F_{k+1}\circ\dots\circ F_{k+r}$$J$ Now the $\wedge$-product of those factors on the left-hand side of (##) that correspond to vertices in the tree $U_{v}$ is precisely equal to $(F_{k+1},\dots,F_{k+r})(U_{v})$. We therefore complete the definition of the map (##) on these factors using the ‘inclusion’ maps $(F_{k+1},\dots,F_{k+r})(U_{v})\to\coprod_{U\in\mathsf{L}_{r}(J)}(F_{k+1},\dots% ,F_{k+r})(U)=(F_{k+1}\circ\dots\circ F_{k+r})(J).$ Putting the maps (##) together for varying $T\in\mathsf{L}_{n}(A)$, we get the required associativity morphism (#).
Definition 3. The relation $\models^{c}$ of satisfaction for c-interpretations is defined by: $M\models^{c}\sigma\quad\text{iff}\quad\lvert\sigma_{M}\rvert=\operatorname{% true}.$ Thus a c-interpretation $M$ satisfies a sentence $\sigma$ just if the following triangle commutes {diagram} 1_$\mathcal{E}$ &\rTo¡σ_M & 1_$\mathcal{E}$+1_$\mathcal{E}$ & \rdTo_true & \dTo¿ |-| && Ω_$\mathcal{E}$.
Definition 3.3. For tensors $D=(F;{\mathfrak{m}})\in{M}^{\otimes F}$ and $D^{\prime}=(F^{\prime};{\mathfrak{m}}^{\prime})\in{M}^{\otimes F^{\prime}}$, define $D\overline{\diamond}D^{\prime}=(F\diamond F^{\prime};{\mathfrak{m}}\overline{% \otimes}{\mathfrak{m}}^{\prime}).$
Definition 3.1. We call ${M}^{\otimes F}$ the module of the forest $F$ with angular decoration by $M$, and call $(F;{\mathfrak{m}})$, for ${\mathfrak{m}}\in M^{\otimes(\ell(F)-1)}$, an angularly decorated forest $F$ with the decoration tensor ${\mathfrak{m}}$.
Definition 4.1. Let $(A,P)$ be a nonunitary Rota–Baxter ${\bf k}$-algebra. A unitarization of $A$ is a unitary Rota–Baxter algebra $(\tilde{A},\tilde{P})$ with a nonunitary Rota-Baxter algebra homomorphism $u_{A}:A\to\tilde{A}$ such that for any unitary Rota–Baxter algebra $B$ and a homomorphism $f:A\to B$ of nonunitary Rota–Baxter algebras, there is a unique homomorphism $\tilde{f}:\tilde{A}\to B$ of unitary Rota-Baxter algebras such that $f=\tilde{f}\circ u_{A}$.
Definition 3.10. Let $(\mathcal{T},\otimes,\iota,\varepsilon)$ be a symmetric tensor C*-category, endowed with the natural $C(X^{\iota})$-category structure. $\mathcal{T}$ is said to be locally trivial if it is locally trivial in the sense of Sec.2.2.2, with the additional property that the local charts preserve tensor product and symmetry.
Definition 2.4. Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a C*-category, $X$ a locally compact Hausdorff space. $\mathcal{C}$ is said to be a $C_{0}(X)$-category if for every $\rho\in{{\bf obj}\ \mathcal{C}}$ there is given a non-degenerate morphism $i_{\rho}:C_{0}(X)\to M({\rho,\rho})$, such that for every $\sigma\in{{\bf obj}\ \mathcal{C}}$, $t\in({\rho,\sigma})$, $f\in C_{0}(X)$, the following equality holds: $t\ i_{\rho}(f)=i_{\sigma}(f)\ t\ .$
Definition 3.3. Let $(\mathcal{T},\otimes,\iota,\varepsilon)$ be a symmetric tensor C*-category. An embedding functor is a C*-monofunctor $i:\mathcal{T}\hookrightarrow{\bf vect}(X^{\iota})$, preserving tensor product and symmetry.
Definition 3.13. A special category is a locally trivial, symmetric tensor C*-category $(\widehat{\rho},\otimes,\iota,\varepsilon)$ with fibre $(\widehat{\rho}_{\bullet},\otimes_{\bullet},\iota_{\bullet},\varepsilon_{% \bullet})$, such that $\rho_{\bullet}$ is a special object.
Definition 2.5. Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a $C_{0}(X)$-category, $x\in X$. The fibre of $\mathcal{C}$ over $x$ is defined as the restriction $\mathcal{C}_{x}:=\mathcal{C}_{\left\{x\right\}}$. The restriction C*-epifunctor $\pi_{x}:\mathcal{C}\to\mathcal{C}_{x}$ is called the fibre functor. We denote by $({\rho,\sigma})_{x}$ the spaces of arrows of $\mathcal{C}_{x}$, $x\in X$.
Definition 3.6. The Chern class of a twisted special object $(\rho,d,\mathcal{V})$ is the unique element $c(\rho)\in H^{2}(X^{\iota},{\mathbb{Z}})$ associated with $\mathcal{L}_{\rho}$.
Definition 3.1. A category $D$ is comonoidal if it comes equipped with a functor $\delta:D\longrightarrow D\otimes D$ such that there is a natural isomorphisms $(\delta\otimes 1_{D})\delta\longrightarrow(1_{D}\otimes\delta)\delta$ satisfying McLane’s pentagon axiom.
Definition 1.4. A Rota-Baxter category of weight $\lambda\in\{-1,0,1\}$ is a distributive category $C$ together with an additive functor $P:C\longrightarrow C$ and natural isomorphisms $\displaystyle P(x)\otimes P(y)\oplus P(x\otimes y)$ $\displaystyle\simeq$ $\displaystyle P(P(x)\otimes y)\oplus P(x\otimes P(y))$ $\displaystyle P(x)\otimes P(y)$ $\displaystyle\simeq$ $\displaystyle P(P(x)\otimes y)\oplus P(x\otimes P(y))$ $\displaystyle P(x)\otimes P(y)$ $\displaystyle\simeq$ $\displaystyle P(P(x)\otimes y)\oplus P(x\otimes P(y))\oplus P(x\otimes y).$ for $x,y$ objects of $C$ and $\lambda=-1,0,1,$ respectively.
Definition 1.1. A category $C$ is distributive if it is equipped with functors $\oplus\colon C\times C\rightarrow C$ and $\otimes\colon C\times C\rightarrow C$ called sum and product, respectively. There are distinguished objects $0$ and $1$ in $C$; $(C,\oplus,0)$ is a symmetric monoidal category with unit $0$; $(C,\otimes,1)$ is a monoidal category with unit $1$. There are natural isomorphisms $x\otimes(y\oplus z)\simeq(x\otimes y)\oplus(x\otimes z)\mbox{\ \ and \ \ }(x% \oplus y)\otimes z\simeq(x\otimes z)\oplus(y\otimes z),$ for $x,y,z$ objects of $C$. A distributive category have negative objects if it comes with a functor $-\colon C\rightarrow C$ and for $x,y$ objects of $C$ there are natural isomorphisms $-(x\oplus y)\simeq-x\oplus-y,\ \ -0\simeq 0,\mbox{\ \ and \ \ }-(-x)\simeq x.$
Definition 1.3. A categorification of a ring $R$ is a distributive category $C$ with negative functor together with a valuation map $|\ \ |\colon Ob(C)\rightarrow R$ such that: $|x|=|y|\mbox{\ \ if \ \ }x\simeq y,\ \ |x\oplus y|=|x|+|y|,\ \ |x\otimes y|=|% x||y|,\ \ |1|=1,\ \ |0|=0,\mbox{\ \ and \ \ }|-x|=-|x|.$

Definition 1.2. Let $C$ be a distributive category. A functor $P:C\rightarrow C$ is additive if for $x,y$ objects of $C$ there are natural isomorphisms $P(x\oplus y)\simeq P(x)\oplus P(y)$. If $C$ has a negative functor we also demand the existence of natural isomorphisms $P(-x)\simeq-P(x)$. $P$ is bimonoidal if it is additive and in addition there are natural isomorphisms $P(x\otimes y)\simeq P(x)\otimes P(y)$.
Definition 2.2. Let $V$ be any set and $E\subseteq V\times V$ be a binary relation over $V$. Then the ordered tuple $G=(V,E)$ is called a graph.
Definition 2.4. Let $V$ and $E$ be sets. $G:E\rightarrow\underbrace{V\times\cdots\times V}_{m\;\textrm{fold}}$ is called a set system or a hypergraph. A set system (hypergraph) may be presented by the diagram $\diagram\node{E}\arrow{e,t}{G}\node{V^{m}}$
Definition 2.6. Let $V$ be any set and let $E$ be a collection of relations over $V$. Then $G=(V,E)$ is called a simple relational system. Let $k_{1}<k_{2}<\cdots<k_{m}$ and let the number of distinct $k_{i}$-ary relations in $E$ be $r_{i}$. Then the symbol $(k^{r_{1}}_{1},k^{r_{2}}_{2},\cdots,k^{r_{m}}_{m})$ is called the type of $G$. The integer $k_{m}$ is called the arity of $E$ and hence of $G$.
Definition 6.2. A reflexive and transitive binary relation is called a quasi-ordering. A quasi-ordering $\leq$ on a set $S$ is a well quasi-ordering, and the elements of $S$ are well quasi-ordered by $\leq$, if for every infinite sequence $x_{0},x_{1},\cdots\in X$, there exist indices $i<j$ such that $x_{i}\leq x_{j}$.
Definition 3.1. (1) The category of all graphs with graph homomorphisms as morphisms. This category is denoted by $\textswab{Gra}$. A homomorphism $f:G\rightarrow H$ is a mapping with $xy\in E(G)\Rightarrow f(x)f(y)\in E(H)$. (2) The category of all graphs with egamorphisms as morphisms. This category is denoted by $\textswab{EGra}$. An egamorphism is a mapping $f:G\rightarrow H$ such that $xy\in E(G)\Rightarrow f(x)f(y)\in E(H)\cup V(G)$. (3) The category of all graphs with comorphisms as morphisms. This category is denoted by $\textswab{CGra}$. A comorphism is a mapping $f:G\rightarrow H$ such that $f(x)f(y)\in E(H)\Rightarrow xy\in E(G)$.
Definition 6.1. A set $S$ is called inductive if there is a well founded order on $S$.

If $G=(G_{1},\cdots,G_{s})$ and $G_{i}:E_{i}\rightarrow\bigcup\limits^{m}_{k=1}[V]^{m},\;i=1,\cdots,s$ then $G:(E_{1},\cdots,E_{s})\rightarrow\bigcup\limits^{m}_{k=1}[V]^{m}$ is called a relational system. A relational system may be presented by the diagram $\diagram\node{E_{1}}\arrow{se,t}{G_{1}}\\ \node{\vdots}\node{\bigcup\limits^{m}_{k=1}[V]^{m}}\\ \node{E_{s}}\arrow{ne,b}{G_{s}}$
Definition 2.1. Let $V$ and $E$ be sets with $V\cap E=\emptyset$. Then a mapping $G:E\rightarrow V\times V$ is called a graph. This may be given by $\diagram\node{E}\arrow{e,t}{G}\node{V\times V}$
Definition 2.7. A simple relational system $G$ with arity $3$ is called a ternary relational system.
Definition 2.3. Let $V$ be a set and let $E=(E_{1},\cdots,E_{s})$ be a collection of sets. If $G=(G_{1},\cdots,G_{s})$ and $G_{i}:E_{i}\rightarrow V\times V,\;i=1,\cdots,s$ then $G:(E_{1},\cdots,E_{s})\rightarrow V\times V$ is called a graph system. A graph system may be presented by the diagram $\diagram\node{E_{1}}\arrow{se,t}{G_{1}}\\ \node{\vdots}\node{V\times V}\\ \node{E_{s}}\arrow{ne,b}{G_{s}}$
5.1 Definition. We first describe a space corresponding to each painted binary tree. We denote it $W(t).$ Edge lengths can be chosen freely from $[0,1]$ subject to the following conditions. At each trivalent node of a tree $t$ there are two subtrees with their root that node. The left subtree is defined by the tree with its rooted edge the left-hand branch of that node and the right subtree is likewise supported by the righthand branch. The conditions are that for each node of type (2) we have an equation relating the painted interior edge lengths of the left subtree and the right subtree (interior with respect to the original $t$). Let $u_{1}\dots u_{k}$ be the lengths of the painted interior edges of the left subtree and let $v_{1}\dots v_{j}$ be the painted lengths of the right subtree. Let $p_{u}$ be the number of leaves of the left subtree and let $p_{v}$ be the number of leaves of the right subtree. The equation to be obeyed is $\frac{1}{p_{u}}\smash{\sum\limits_{i=1}^{k}u_{i}}=\frac{1}{p_{v}}\smash{\sum% \limits_{i=1}^{j}v_{i}}.$
6.2 Definition. The upper facets ${\mathcal{J}}(t;r_{1},\dots,r_{t})$ correspond to upper trees such as: $\xy(0,0)*{u(t;r_{1},\dots,r_{t})=}\endxy\xy(0,0)*{\xy 0;/r.45pc/:(-.5,23)*{{}^% {0}}="a";(1.5,25.25)*{{r_{1}\atop\overbrace{~{}~{}~{}}}};(1.5,23)*{\dots};(3.5% ,23)*=0{}="b";(4.5,23)*=0{}="a2";(6.5,25.25)*{{r_{2}\atop\overbrace{~{}~{}~{}}% }};(6.5,23)*{\dots};(8.5,23)*=0{}="b2";(12,23)*=0{}="a3";(14,25.25)*{{r_{t}% \atop\overbrace{~{}~{}~{}}}};(14,23)*{\dots~{}~{}};(16,23)*{~{}~{}^{~{}n-1}}="% b3";(2,20)*=0{\bullet}="d";(6,20)*=0{\bullet}="e";(14,20)*=0{\bullet}="f";(9,1% 7)*{\dots};(8,14)*=0{\bullet}="v2";(8,8)*=0{}="v4";\ar@{};"d";"v2"\ar@{-};"d";% "v2"\ar@{-};"a";"d"\ar@{-};"b";"d"\ar@{-};"a2";"e"\ar@{-};"b2";"e"\ar@{-};"a3"% ;"f"\ar@{-};"b3";"f"\ar@{-};"e";"v2"\ar@{-};"f";"v2"\ar@{-};"v2";"v4"\ar@{-};% \ar@{};"d";"v2"\ar@{=};"d";"v2"\ar@{=};"e";"v2"\ar@{=};"f";"v2"\ar@{=};"v2";"v% 4"\ar@{=};\endxy}\endxy$ These are assigned a hyperplane $H_{q}(u(t;r_{1},\dots,r_{t}))$ determined by the equation $x_{r_{1}}+x_{(r_{1}+r_{2})}+\dots+x_{(r_{1}+r_{2}+\dots+r_{t-1})}={1\over 2}% \left(n(n-1)-\sum_{i=1}^{t}r_{i}(r_{i}-1)\right)$ or equivalently: $x_{r_{1}}+x_{(r_{1}+r_{2})}+\dots+x_{(r_{1}+r_{2}+\dots+r_{t-1})}=\sum_{1\leq i% <j\leq t}r_{i}r_{j}.$
2.3 Definition. The upper trees $u(t;r_{1},\dots,r_{t})$ with all interior (necessarily painted) edges attached to a single painted node will appear thus: $\xy(0,0)*{u(t;r_{1},\dots,r_{t})=}\endxy\xy(0,0)*{\xy 0;/r.45pc/:(-.5,23)*{{}^% {0}}="a";(1.5,25.25)*{{r_{1}\atop\overbrace{~{}~{}~{}}}};(1.5,23)*{\dots};(3.5% ,23)*=0{}="b";(4.5,23)*=0{}="a2";(6.5,25.25)*{{r_{2}\atop\overbrace{~{}~{}~{}}% }};(6.5,23)*{\dots};(8.5,23)*=0{}="b2";(12,23)*=0{}="a3";(14,25.25)*{{r_{t}% \atop\overbrace{~{}~{}~{}}}};(14,23)*{\dots~{}~{}};(16,23)*{~{}~{}^{~{}n-1}}="% b3";(2,20)*=0{\bullet}="d";(6,20)*=0{\bullet}="e";(14,20)*=0{\bullet}="f";(9,1% 7)*{\dots};(8,14)*=0{\bullet}="v2";(8,8)*=0{}="v4";\ar@{};"d";"v2"\ar@{-};"d";% "v2"\ar@{-};"a";"d"\ar@{-};"b";"d"\ar@{-};"a2";"e"\ar@{-};"b2";"e"\ar@{-};"a3"% ;"f"\ar@{-};"b3";"f"\ar@{-};"e";"v2"\ar@{-};"f";"v2"\ar@{-};"v2";"v4"\ar@{-};% \ar@{};"d";"v2"\ar@{=};"d";"v2"\ar@{=};"e";"v2"\ar@{=};"f";"v2"\ar@{=};"v2";"v% 4"\ar@{=};\endxy}\endxy$ In [17] the corresponding upper facets are labeled ${\mathcal{J}}(t;r_{1},\dots,r_{t}).$ Here $t$ is the number of painted interior edges and $r_{i}$ is the number of leaves in the subtree supported by the $i^{th}$ interior edge. In the complex ${\mathcal{J}}(n)$ defined in [17] the upper facet ${\mathcal{J}}(t;r_{1},\dots,r_{t})$ is a combinatorial copy of the complex ${\mathcal{K}}(t)\times{\mathcal{J}}(r_{1})\times\dots\times{\mathcal{J}}(r_{t}).$
2.2 Definition. A lower tree $l(k,s)$ is determined by a selection of $s$ consecutive leaves of the painted corolla, $1<s\leq n$, which will be the leaves of the subtree which has the sole interior edge as its root edge. $\xy(0,0)*{l(k,s)=}\endxy\xy(0,0)*{\xy 0;/r.45pc/:(-8,22)*{{s\atop\overbrace{~{% }~{}~{}~{}~{}~{}~{}~{}~{}}}};(-22,20)*{{}^{0}}="L";(6,20)*{{}^{n-1}}="R";(-14,% 20)*=0{}="a";(-10,20)*{{}^{k-1}}="b";(-6,20)*=0{}="b2";(-2,20)*=0{}="c";(-8,14% )*=0{\bullet}="v1";(-8,8)*=0{}="v3";(-8,16)*=0{\bullet}="v0";(-15,18)*{\dots};% (-1,18)*{\dots};(-8,19)*{\dots};"a";"v1"\ar@{-};"a";"v1"\ar@{-};"L";"v1"\ar@{-% };"R";"v1"\ar@{-};"b";"v0"\ar@{-};"b2";"v0"\ar@{-};"v0";"v1"\ar@{-};"v1";"c"% \ar@{-};"v1";"v3"\ar@{-};\ar@{};"v1";"v3"\ar@{=};"v1";"v3"\ar@{=};\endxy}\endxy$ To each lower tree corresponds a lower facet of the multiplihedron, which in [17] are denoted ${\mathcal{J}}_{k}(r,s)$ where $r=n+1-s.$ Here $k$ is the first “gap between branches” of the $s-1$ consecutive gaps (that is, $k-1$ is the first leaf of the $s$ consecutive leaves.) In the complex ${\mathcal{J}}(n)$ defined in [17] the lower facet ${\mathcal{J}}_{k}(r,s)$ is a combinatorial copy of the complex ${\mathcal{J}}(r)\times{\mathcal{K}}(s).$
2.5 Definition. The first multiplihedron denoted $\mathcal{J}(1)$ is defined to be the single point $\{*\}.$ It is associated to the painted tree with one leaf, and thus one type (3) internal node. Assume that the $\mathcal{J}(k)$ have been defined for $k=1\dots n-1.$ To $\mathcal{J}(k)$ we associate the $k$-leaved painted corolla. We define an $(n-2)$-dimensional $CW$-complex $\partial\mathcal{J}(n)$ as follows, and then define $\mathcal{J}(n)$ to be the cone on $\partial\mathcal{J}(n)$. Now the top-dimensional cells of $\partial\mathcal{J}(n)$ (upper and lower facets of $\mathcal{J}(n)$) are in bijection with the set of painted trees of two types, upper and lower trees as defined above. Each sub-facet of an upper or lower facet is labeled with a tree that is a refinement of the upper or lower tree. Since the facets are products, their sub-facets in turn are products of faces (of smaller associahedra and multiplihedra) whose dimensions sum to $n-3.$ Each of these sub-facets thus comes (inductively) with a list of associated trees. There will always be a unique way of grafting the trees on this list to construct a painted tree that is a minimal refinement of the upper or lower tree associated to the facet in question. For the sub-facets of an upper facet the recipe is to paint entirely the $t$-leaved tree associated to a face of $\mathcal{K}(t)$ and to graft to each of its branches in turn the trees associated to the appropriate faces of $\mathcal{J}(r_{1})$ through $\mathcal{J}(r_{t})$ respectively. A sub-facet of the lower facet $\mathcal{J}_{k}(r,s)$ inductively comes with pair of trees. The recipe for assigning our sub-facet an $n$-leaved minimal refinement of the $n$-leaved minimal lower tree $l(k,s)$ is to graft the unpainted $s$-leaved tree to the $k^{th}$ leaf of the painted $r$-leaved tree. The intersection of two facets in the boundary of $\mathcal{J}(n)$ occurs along sub-facets of each which have associated painted trees that are identical. Then $\mathcal{J}(n)$ is defined to be the cone on $\partial\mathcal{J}(n).$ To $\mathcal{J}(n)$ we assign the painted corolla of $n$ leaves.
5.3 Definition. Now the space of painted metric trees with $n$ leaves $LW\mathcal{U}(n)$ is formed by first taking the disjoint union of the $(n-1)$-dimensional polytopes $W(t),$ one polytope for each binary painted tree. Then it is given the quotient topology (of the standard topology of the disjoint union of the polytopes in R${}^{k}$) under the following equivalence relation: Two trees are equivalent if they reduce to the same tree after shrinking to points their respective edges of length zero. This is why we call the variable assigned to interior edges “length” in the first place. By “same tree” we mean possessing the same painted tree structure and having the same lengths assigned to corresponding edges. For example one pair of equivalence relations appears as follows: $\xy 0;/r.85pc/:(-16,8)*=0{}="a";(-12,8)*=0{}="b";(-8,8)*=0{}="c";(-4,8)*=0{}="% d";(0,8)*=0{}="e";(4,8)*=0{}="f";(8,8)*=0{}="g";(12,8)*=0{}="h";(16,8)*=0{}="i% ";(-6,4)*{=};(6,4)*{=};(-10,6)*=0{\bullet}="v1";(-12,4)*=0{\bullet}="v2";(-12,% 2)*{\bullet}="v3";(-12,0)*{}="v4";(10,6)*=0{\bullet}="v6";(12,4)*=0{\bullet}="% v7";(12,2)*{\bullet}="v8";(12,0)*{}="v9";(0,4)*=0{\bullet}="va";(0,0)*=0{}="vb% ";\ar@{};"a";"v2"\ar@{-};"a";"v2"\ar@{-};"b";"v1"\ar@{-};"c";"v1"\ar@{-}_{0};"% v1";"v2"\ar@{-}^{0};"v2";"v3"\ar@{-};"v3";"v4"\ar@{-};"d";"va"\ar@{-};"e";"va"% \ar@{-};"f";"va"\ar@{-};"va";"vb"\ar@{-};"g";"v6"\ar@{-};"h";"v6"\ar@{-};"i";"% v7"\ar@{-}^{0};"v6";"v7"\ar@{-}^{0};"v7";"v8"\ar@{-};"v8";"v9"\ar@{-};"v3";"v4% "\ar@{=};"v3";"v4"\ar@{=};"va";"vb"\ar@{=};"v8";"v9"\ar@{=};\endxy$
6.5 Definition.
2.1 Definition. By refinement of painted trees we refer to the relationship: $t$ refines $t^{\prime}$ means that $t^{\prime}$ results from the collapse of some of the internal edges of $t$. This is a partial order on $n$-leaved painted trees, and we write $t<t^{\prime}.$ Thus the binary painted trees are refinements of the trees having nodes of type (4)-(6). Minimal refinement refers to the following specific case of refinement: $t$ minimally refines $t^{\prime\prime}$ means that $t$ refines $t^{\prime\prime}$ and also that there is no $t^{\prime}$ such that both $t$ refines $t^{\prime}$ and $t^{\prime}$ refines $t^{\prime\prime}$.
6.7 Definition.
6.1 Definition. The lower facets ${\mathcal{J}}_{k}(r,s)$ correspond to lower trees such as: $\xy(0,0)*{l(k,s)=}\endxy\xy(0,0)*{\xy 0;/r.45pc/:(-8,22)*{{s\atop\overbrace{~{% }~{}~{}~{}~{}~{}~{}~{}~{}}}};(-22,20)*{{}^{0}}="L";(6,20)*{{}^{n-1}}="R";(-14,% 20)*=0{}="a";(-10,20)*{{}^{k-1}}="b";(-6,20)*=0{}="b2";(-2,20)*=0{}="c";(-8,14% )*=0{\bullet}="v1";(-8,8)*=0{}="v3";(-8,16)*=0{\bullet}="v0";(-15,18)*{\dots};% (-1,18)*{\dots};(-8,19)*{\dots};"a";"v1"\ar@{-};"a";"v1"\ar@{-};"L";"v1"\ar@{-% };"R";"v1"\ar@{-};"b";"v0"\ar@{-};"b2";"v0"\ar@{-};"v0";"v1"\ar@{-};"v1";"c"% \ar@{-};"v1";"v3"\ar@{-};\ar@{};"v1";"v3"\ar@{=};"v1";"v3"\ar@{=};\endxy}\endxy$ These are assigned a hyperplane $H_{q}(l(k,s))$ determined by the equation $x_{k}+\dots+x_{k+s-2}={q\over 2}s(s-1).$
Definition. Let $\mathcal{A},\mathcal{B}$ be Ann-categories. An Ann-functor from $\mathcal{A}$ to $\mathcal{B}$ is a triple $(F,\breve{F},\widetilde{F})$ where $(F,\breve{F})$ is a symmetric monoidal $\oplus$-functor and $(F,\widetilde{F})$ is a monoidal $\otimes$-functor so that following diagrams $\diagram\node{F(X(Y\oplus Z))}\arrow{e,t}{\widetilde{F}}\arrow{s,l}{F(\mathcal% {L})}\node{FXF(Y\oplus Z)}\arrow{e,t}{id\otimes\breve{F}}\node{FX(FY\oplus FZ)% }\arrow{s,r}{\mathcal{L}^{\prime}}\\ \node{F((XY)\oplus(XZ))}\arrow{e,t}{\breve{F}}\node{F(XY)\oplus F(XZ)}\arrow{e% ,t}{\widetilde{F}\oplus\widetilde{F}}\node{(FXFY)\oplus(FXFZ)}$ $\diagram\node{F((X\oplus Y)\otimes Z)}\arrow{e,t}{\widetilde{F}}\arrow{s,l}{F(% \mathcal{R})}\node{F(X\oplus Y)FZ}\arrow{e,t}{\breve{F}\otimes id}\node{(FX% \oplus FY)FZ}\arrow{s,r}{\mathcal{R}^{\prime}}\\ \node{F((XZ)\oplus(YZ))}\arrow{e,t}{\breve{F}}\node{F(XZ)\oplus F(YZ)}\arrow{e% ,t}{\widetilde{F}\oplus\widetilde{F}}\node{(FXFZ)\oplus(FYFZ)}$ commute
Definition. Let $R$ be a ring with identity $1\neq 0$ and $A$ be a $R$-bimodule. An Ann-category $\mathcal{I}$ of type $(R,A)$ is a category whose objects are elements of $R$ and whose morphisms are endomorphisms. In the concrete, for $r,s\in R,$ we define $Hom(r,s)=\emptyset\ \ \textrm{where}\ \ r\neq s$ $Hom(s,s)=Aut(s)=\{s\}\times A.$ The composite of two morphisms is induced by addition in $A.$ Two tensor products $\otimes,\oplus$ on $\mathcal{I}$ are defined by $\displaystyle r\oplus s$ $\displaystyle=$ $\displaystyle r+s\ \ \textrm{(addition in ring $R$)}$ $\displaystyle(r,u)\oplus(s,v)$ $\displaystyle=$ $\displaystyle(r+s,u+v)$ $\displaystyle r\otimes s$ $\displaystyle=$ $\displaystyle rs\ \ \textrm{(product in ring $R$)}$ $\displaystyle(r,u)\otimes(s,v)$ $\displaystyle=$ $\displaystyle(rs,rv+us).$ Constraints on $\mathcal{I}$ are defined to be a family $(\xi,\eta,(0,id,id),\alpha,(1,id,id),\lambda,\rho)$ where $\eta:R^{2}\to A,\ \alpha,\lambda,\rho:R^{3}\to A$ are functions so that the set of axioms of an Ann-category is satisfied.
Definition. Two structures $f=(\xi,\eta,\alpha,\lambda,\rho)$ and $f^{\prime}=(\xi,\eta,\alpha,\lambda,\rho)$ of Ann-category of type $(R,A)$ are cohomologous iff there is an Ann-functor $(F,\breve{F},\widetilde{F}):(R,A,f)\longrightarrow(R,A,f^{\prime})$ where $F=id.$
