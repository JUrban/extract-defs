Definition 2.4. A natural system $D:F{\mathscr{E}}\rightarrow{\mathscr{A}}$ is called local if the adjoint functor $R_{b}$ of the inclusion functor $j_{b}:{\mathscr{E}}_{b}\to b/u$ induces an isomorphism in Baues-Wirsching cohomology $H^{q}_{BW}(b/u,D_{b})\cong H^{q}_{BW}({\mathscr{E}}_{b},D\circ Fi_{b})$ for every $q$ and every object $b$ of the base category ${\mathscr{B}}$, i. e. we have a natural isomorphism of local coefficient systems ${\mathcal{H}}^{q}_{BW}(-/u,D_{(-)})\cong{\mathcal{H}}^{q}_{BW}({\mathscr{E}}_{% (-)},D\circ Fi_{(-)}).$
Definition 1.9. Let ${\mathscr{C}}$ be a small category and let $D:F{\mathscr{C}}\rightarrow{\mathscr{A}}$ be a natural system with values in a cocomplete abelian category ${\mathscr{A}}$ with exact coproducts. We define the Baues-Wirsching chain complex $C^{BW}_{*}({\mathscr{C}},D)$ as follows: For each integer $n\geq 0$ the $n$-th chain object is given by $C^{BW}_{n}({\mathscr{C}},D)=\bigoplus_{C_{0}\stackrel{{\scriptstyle f_{1}}}{{% \leftarrow}}C_{1}\stackrel{{\scriptstyle f_{2}}}{{\leftarrow}}\cdots\stackrel{% {\scriptstyle f_{n}}}{{\leftarrow}}C_{n}}D(f_{1}\circ f_{2}\circ\cdots\circ f_% {n}).$ Let $\lambda=(C_{0}\stackrel{{\scriptstyle f_{1}}}{{\leftarrow}}C_{1}\stackrel{{% \scriptstyle f_{2}}}{{\leftarrow}}\cdots\stackrel{{\scriptstyle f_{n}}}{{% \leftarrow}}C_{n})$ be a string of $n$ composable arrows and let $in_{\lambda}:D(\lambda)\hookrightarrow C^{BW}_{n}({\mathscr{C}},D)$ be the inclusion. We first define $d_{i}:C^{BW}_{n}({\mathscr{C}},D)\rightarrow C^{BW}_{n-1}({\mathscr{C}},D),\,% \,\,0\leq i\leq n.$ by setting $d_{i}\circ in_{\lambda}=\begin{cases}in_{d_{0}\lambda}\circ D(id_{C_{0}}\circ f% _{n}),&\text{if }i=0,\\ in_{d_{i}\lambda},&\text{if }0<i<n,\\ in_{d_{n}\lambda}\circ D(f_{0}\circ id_{C_{n}}),&\text{if }i=n.\end{cases}$ Here $d_{i}\lambda$ is the $i$-th face of the string in the nerve $N_{\bullet}{\mathscr{C}}$. The differential $d:C^{BW}_{n}({\mathscr{C}},D)\rightarrow C^{BW}_{n-1}({\mathscr{C}},D)$ is given by the alternating sum $d=\sum_{i=0}^{n}(-1)^{i}d_{i}.$ The $n$-th Baues-Wirsching homology is defined as $H_{n}^{BW}({\mathscr{C}},D)=H_{n}(C^{BW}_{*}({\mathscr{C}},D),d).$
Definition 1.7. Let ${\mathscr{M}}$ be a category. A functor $D:F{\mathscr{C}}\rightarrow{\mathscr{M}}$ is called a natural system with values in ${\mathscr{M}}$. For $\alpha,f,\beta$ as above we write $\displaystyle\alpha^{*}$ $\displaystyle=D(\alpha,1):D(f)\to D(f\circ\alpha)$ $\displaystyle\beta_{*}$ $\displaystyle=D(1,\beta):D(f)\to D(\beta\circ f).$
Definition 1.22. A (finitary) algebraic theory is a category whose objects are the natural numbers ${\mathbb{N}}$, denoted ${\mathbb{0}},{\mathbb{1}},{\mathbb{2}},\dots\mathbb{n},\ldots,$ equipped with distinguished isomorphisms $\phi_{n}\colon{\mathbb{n}}\stackrel{{\scriptstyle\cong}}{{\longrightarrow}}{% \mathbb{1}}^{n}$ between each object ${\mathbb{n}}$ and the product of $n$ copies of the object ${\mathbb{1}}$. Morphisms between algebraic theories are simply functors which are identities on objects and preserve finite products, i. e. functors preserving the morphisms $\phi_{n}$ for all $n$. The category of algebraic theories will be denoted by ${\mathfrak{Theories}}$.
Definition 3.2.14. As usual, we denote by $\mathbf{N}^{*}$ the set of finite sequences in $\mathbf{N}$. Given $s,t\in\mathbf{N}^{*}$, we write $s\preceq t$ if $s$ is an initial segment of $t$. A tree (for us) is a non-empty subset $T$ of $\mathbf{N}^{*}$ that is closed under initial segments, i.e. if $s\in T$ and $s^{\prime}\in\mathbf{N}^{*}$ with $s^{\prime}\preceq s$ then $s^{\prime}\in T$. A tree is well-founded if it admits no infinite chain w.r.t. the ordering $\preceq$. We may abbreviate ‘well-founded tree’ to wf-tree. Let $T$ be a tree. Given $t\in T$, we write $\mathrm{Out}_{T}(t)=\{x\in\mathbf{N}\mid t\textnormal{:}x\in T\}$. An element $s\in T$ may be called a node of $T$. A node $s$ of $T$ is a leaf if $s$ is a maximal in $T$ w.r.t. $\preceq$. We denote by $\mathrm{Lvs}(T)$ the set of leaves in $T$. Let $t\in T$. We write $\mathrm{Subtree}_{T}(t)=\{s\in\mathbf{N}^{*}\mid t*s\in T\}\subseteq\mathbf{N}% ^{*}$. It is easy to see that $\mathrm{Subtree}_{T}(t)$ is a tree. We say that $\mathrm{Subtree}_{T}(t)$ is the subtree of $T$ at $t$.
Definition 1.2.21. In a category, a partial map $X\rightharpoonup Y$ is a pair $(U,f)$, where $U$ is a subobject of an object $X$ and $f$ is a map $U\rightarrow Y$. Let $Y$ be an object of a category. A partial map classifier of $Y$ is an object $\tilde{Y}$ and a monomorphism $\eta:Y\hookrightarrow\tilde{Y}$ with the following property: for every partial map $X\stackrel{{\scriptstyle m}}{{\hookleftarrow}}U\xrightarrow{f}Y$ there is unique map $\tilde{f}:X\rightarrow Y$ such that the square {diagram} U & \rTof & Y \dEmtom & & \dToη X & \rDato~f & ~Y is a pullback.
Definition 2.2.1. Internally in a topos $\mathcal{E}$, we may call elements of $\Omega$ truth values. Given a local operator $j$, we call a truth value $p$ • $j$-closed if $j(p)$ implies $p$, and • $j$-dense if $j(p)$ holds.
Definition 3.4.1. For $D\subseteq\mathbf{N}$, we write $\rho_{D}(n)=\begin{cases}\{\{0\}\}&\text{if }n\in D,\\ \{\{1\}\}&\text{otherwise}.\end{cases}$ We might say that $\rho_{D}\in{\mathrm{P}\mathrm{P}\mathbf{N}}^{\mathbf{N}}$ gives the Turing degree topology of $D$.
Definition 1.1.1. A preorder-enriched category is a category $\mathcal{C}$ together with, for each pair $A,B$ of objects of $\mathcal{C}$, a preordering on the collection of arrows $\mathcal{C}(A,B)$, such that for every triple $A,B,C$ of objects of $C$ the composition mapping $\mathcal{C}(B,C)\times\mathcal{C}(A,B)\rightarrow\mathcal{C}(A,C)$ is order-preserving. Let $\mathcal{C},\mathcal{D}$ be preorder-enriched categories. A pseudofunctor $F:\mathcal{C}\rightarrow\mathcal{D}$ is the data • for each object $X$ of $\mathcal{C}$, an object $F(X)$ of $\mathcal{D}$, • for each arrow $f:X\rightarrow Y$ in $\mathcal{C}$, an arrow $F(f):F(X)\rightarrow F(Y)$, such that • for $X,Y\in\mathrm{Ob}(C)$, the assignment $\mathcal{C}(X,Y)\rightarrow\mathcal{D}(F(X),F(Y)):f\mapsto F(f)$ is monotone, • for each object $X$ of $\mathcal{C}$, we have $F(\mathrm{id}_{X})\cong\mathrm{id}_{F(X)}$, • for arrows $X\xrightarrow{f}Y$ and $Y\xrightarrow{g}Z$, we have $F(g\circ f)\cong F(g)\circ F(g)$. Let $F,G$ be pseudofunctors $\mathcal{C}\rightarrow\mathcal{D}$. A pseudo-natural transformation $\Phi:F\rightarrow G$ is the data • for each object $X$ of $\mathcal{C}$ an arrow $\Phi_{X}:F(X)\rightarrow G(X)$ such that for every arrow $a:X\rightarrow Y$ in $\mathcal{C}$ the diagram in $\mathcal{D}$ {diagram} F(X) & \rToΦ_X & G(X) \dToF(a) & & \dTo_G(a) F(Y) & \rToΦ_Y & G(Y) pseudo-commutes, i.e. commutes up to isomorphism.
Definition 1.2.28. Let $P$ be a tripos over a cartesian closed category $\mathcal{C}$. A closure transformation on $P$ is a transformation $\Phi:P\rightarrow P$ such that for each $X\in\mathrm{Ob}(\mathcal{C})$ the function $\Phi_{X}:P(X)\rightarrow P(X)$ is a closure operator.
Definition 3.2.7. Given $\mathcal{A}\in{\mathrm{P}\mathrm{P}\mathbf{N}}$, a sight $S$ is said to be on $\mathcal{A}$ if each subsight of $S$ of the form $(A^{\prime},\sigma^{\prime})$ satisfies $A^{\prime}\in\mathcal{A}$.
Definition 3.6.15. Let $T\subseteq\mathbf{N}^{*}$. We define a relation $\leq$ on $T$ by $t\leq t^{\prime}$ $\iff$ $\mathrm{len}(t)<\mathrm{len}(t^{\prime})$, or $\mathrm{len}(t)=\mathrm{len}(t^{\prime})$ and $t\leq_{\mathrm{lex}}t^{\prime}$. This relation is a well-order.
Definition 3.1.8. Let $I$ be a set. Let $P$ be a poset with $I$-indexed joins. We say that an element $p\in P$ is inaccessible by $I$-indexed joins if $\forall p_{(-)}\in P^{I}.p\leq\bigvee_{i\in I}p_{i}\Rightarrow\exists i\in I.p% \leq p_{i}.$
Definition 3.2.25. We define inductively a relation ‘$\theta$-realizes’ between the natural numbers and the arithmetic sentences. Let $n\in\mathbf{N}$. • Let $\sigma,\tau$ be closed terms in the language of arithmetic. We say that $n$ $\theta$-realizes the sentence $\sigma=\tau$ if $\llbracket^{\mathbf{N}}\sigma\rrbracket=n=\llbracket^{\mathbf{N}}\tau\rrbracket$, where the latter denote the interpretation of the terms $\sigma,\tau$ in the standard model $\mathbf{N}$. Let $\phi,\psi$ be arithmetic sentences. • We say that $n$ $\theta$-realizes $\phi\wedge\psi$ if, writing $n=\langle n_{1},n_{2}\rangle$, $n_{1}$ $\theta$-realizes $\phi$ and $n_{2}$ $\theta$-realizes $\psi$. • We say that $n$ $\theta$-realizes $\phi\vee\psi$ if, writing $n=\langle g,m\rangle$, either, $g=0$ and $m$ $\theta$-realizes $\phi$, or, $g=1$ and $m$ $\theta$-realizes $\psi$. • We say that $n$ $\theta$-realizes $\phi\Rightarrow\psi$ if for every $\theta$-realizer $m$ of $\phi$ there is a $(n(m),\theta)$-dedicated sight $S$ such that every $n(m)$-value of $S$ $\theta$-realizes $\psi$. • We say that $n$ $\theta$-realizes $\forall x.\phi(x)$ if for every $x\in\mathbf{N}$ there is a $(n,\theta)$-dedicated sight $S$ such that for every $n$-value $m$ of $S$ there is a $(m(x),\theta)$-dedicated sight $T$ whose $m(x)$-values $\theta$-realize $\phi(x)$. • We say that $n$ $\theta$-realizes $\exists x.\phi(x)$ if there are $x,m\in\mathbf{N}$ such that $n=\langle x,m\rangle$ and $m$ $\theta$-realizes $\phi(x)$.
Definition 1.3.3. The associations $\displaystyle\mathbf{Set}$ $\displaystyle\rightarrow$ $\displaystyle\mathbf{Eff}$ $\displaystyle X$ $\displaystyle\mapsto$ $\displaystyle(X,\stackrel{{\scriptstyle\nabla}}{{=}})$ $\displaystyle X\xrightarrow{f}Y$ $\displaystyle\mapsto$ $\displaystyle(X,\stackrel{{\scriptstyle\nabla}}{{=}})\xrightarrow{f}(Y,% \stackrel{{\scriptstyle\nabla}}{{=}}).$ comprise a functor. We will denote this functor by $\nabla$.
Definition 3.2.10. Let $z\in\mathbf{N}$, and let $S$ be a sight. We say that $z$ is r-defined on $S$ if $z$ is defined on every leaf of $S$. If $z$ is r-defined on $S$, we define the image of $S$ under $z$ to be the set $z[S]:=\{z[s]\mid\text{$s$ is a leaf of $S$}\}.$ A $z$-value of $S$ is an element of $z[S]$.
Definition 3.6.20. Let $n\in\mathbf{N}$. Let $s=(c_{1},\ldots,c_{p})\in S_{n}$. Let $t=(d_{1},\ldots,d_{q})\in T_{s}$ with $q<\mathrm{stage}(s)$. (a) There is unique $r<p$ with $t=\mathrm{lLeaf}(T_{(c_{1},\ldots,c_{r})})$. Define $c_{n,s}(t)=c_{r+1}$.27Alternatively, we could define $c_{n,s}(t)=\max(\mathrm{Out}_{T_{s}}(t))$. But the description we have taken allows us to have the core property (b) immediately. (b) We have $b_{n}(t)\leq c_{s}(t)$. (c) The assignment $(n\in\mathbf{N},s\in S_{n},t\in T_{s}^{<\mathrm{stage}(s)})\mapsto(c_{n,s}(t)% \in\mathbf{N})$ is effective.
Definition 3.1.19. Internally in $\mathbf{Eff}$, let $j\in\mathrm{Lo}$. We say that $j$ is basic if $j=\mathrm{lo}_{\mathcal{A}}$ for some $A\in\nabla({\mathrm{P}\mathrm{P}\mathbf{N}})$.
Definition 3.3.6. Let $\mathcal{A}\in{\mathrm{P}\mathrm{P}\mathbf{N}}$. Define $\mathcal{A}^{*}=\{(\bigcup\mathcal{A})\backslash A\mid A\in\mathcal{A}\}.$ We say that $\mathcal{A}^{*}$ is the dual collection of $\mathcal{A}$. Note that $|\mathcal{A}^{*}|=|\mathcal{A}|$.
Definition. We define a notion of ‘interpretation’ of the language of arithmetic in $\mathcal{E}$ w.r.t. $(N,0,\mathrm{suc})$. The interpretation of the symbols $0$ and $\mathrm{suc}$ are respectively the maps $0:1\rightarrow N$ and $\mathrm{suc}:N\rightarrow N$. The interpretation of a (first- or higher-order) arithmetic term/formula is the term/formula in the language of $\mathcal{E}$ obtained in the obvious way from the notion of interpretation of the symbols $0$ and $\mathrm{suc}$.
Definition 3.4.12. Let $g:\mathbf{N}\rightharpoonup\mathbf{N}$ be a partial function, let $R\subseteq\mathbf{N}$, and let $j$ be a local operator on $\mathbf{Eff}$. We say that $g$ is defined on $R$ in $j$ if $g_{j}$ is defined on $R_{j}$. We say that $g$ is effective in $j$ if $g$ is defined on $\mathrm{Dom}(g)$ in $j$.
Definition 3.2.5. Let $S$ be a sight. A finite sequence $(x_{1},\ldots,x_{n})$ in $\mathbf{N}$ is a node of $S$ if, by induction on $n$, • if $n=0$, always, • if $n>0$, then $S=(A,\sigma)$, $x_{1}\in A$ and $(x_{2},\ldots,x_{n})$ is a node of $\sigma(x_{1})$. We denote by $\mathrm{Nds}(S)$ the set of nodes of $S$. Given a node $(x_{1},\ldots,x_{n})$ of $S$, the subsight of $S$ at $(x_{1},\ldots,x_{n})$, to be denoted $\mathrm{Subsight}_{S}(x_{1},\ldots,x_{n})$, is, by induction on $n$, • if $n=0$, then it is the sight $S$, • if $n>0$, then it is the subsight of $\sigma(x_{1})$ at $(x_{2},\ldots,x_{n})$. A node $s$ of $S$ is a leaf if $\mathrm{Subsight}_{S}(s)=\mathrm{Nil}$. Given a node $s$ of $S$, we write $\mathrm{Out}_{S}(s)=\{x\in\mathbf{N}\mid\text{$s\textnormal{:}x$ is a node of % $S$}\}$. Note that if $\mathrm{Subsight}_{S}(s)=(B,\_)$, then $\mathrm{Out}_{S}(s)=B$.
Definition 1.2.25. Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a cartesian closed category. A geometric morphism $P\rightarrow Q$ of $\mathcal{C}$-triposes is a pair $(\Phi_{+},\Phi^{+})$, where $\Phi_{+}:P\rightarrow Q$ and $\Phi^{+}:Q\rightarrow P$ are transformations of triposes such that for each $X\in\mathrm{Ob}(C)$ we have $(\Phi^{+})_{X}\dashv(\Phi_{+})_{X}$ and the preorder map $(\Phi^{+})_{X}$ preserves finite meets; we call $\Phi_{+}$ the direct image part and $\Phi^{+}$ the inverse image part. A geometric inclusion of triposes is a geometric morphism whose direct image transformation is componentwise fully faithful (i.e. not only preserves but also reflects the preorder). A subtripos of a $\mathcal{C}$-tripos $P$ is an isomorphism class of geometric inclusions into $P$.
Definition 1.1.4. Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a cartesian closed category. A $\mathcal{C}$-tripos (or a tripos over $\mathcal{C}$) is a pseudofunctor $P:\mathcal{C}^{\mathrm{op}}\rightarrow\mathbf{Heytpre}$ satisfying the following conditions: (i) For every $\mathcal{C}$-morphism $f:X\rightarrow Y$, the map $P(f):P(Y)\rightarrow P(X)$ has (as a map of preorders) both a left adjoint $\exists_{f}$ and a right adjoint $\forall_{f}$ that satisfy the so-called Beck-Chevalley condition: if {diagram} X & \rTof & Y \dTog & & \dToh Z & \rTok & W is a pullback square in $\mathcal{C}$, then the composite maps of preorders $\forall_{f}\circ P(g)$ and $P(h)\circ\forall_{k}$ are isomorphic. (ii) There is a $\mathcal{C}$-object $\Sigma$ and an element $\sigma$ of $P(\Sigma)$ such that for every object $X$ of $\mathcal{C}$ and every $\phi\in P(X)$ there is a morphism $[\phi]:X\rightarrow\Sigma$ such that $\phi$ and $P([\phi])(\sigma)$ are isomorphic elements of $P(X)$. (Such a pair $(\Sigma,\sigma)$ is called a generic element.) We may call elements of $P(X)$ predicates. A tripos with specific structure is a tripos $P$ equipped with • for each object $X$ of $\mathcal{C}$, particular top, bottom, meet, join and implication operations on $P(X)$, (so each $P(X)$ is a Heyting prealgebra with specific structure) • for each arrow $a:X\rightarrow Y$ in $\mathcal{C}$, particular left and right adjoints to the map $P(a):P(Y)\rightarrow P(X)$, and • a particular generic element.
Definition. Let $X$ be a set. A possibly-undefined element of $X$ is either an element of $X$ or something written $\uparrow$ (pronounce: undefined). Let $x$ be a possibly-undefined element of $X$. If $x$ is an element of $X$, we say that $x$ is defined and write $x\textnormal{\textdownarrow}$.
Definition 1.1.7. A transformation $P\rightarrow Q$ of $\mathcal{C}$-triposes is just a pseudo-natural transformation, with $P,Q$ considered as pseudofunctors $\mathcal{C}\rightarrow\mathbf{Preord}$ (instead of $\mathcal{C}\rightarrow\mathbf{Heytpre}$).
Definition 3.1.24. We define $(\nabla({\mathrm{P}\mathrm{P}\mathbf{N}}^{\mathbf{N}}),\leq_{\mathrm{mo}})$ and $(\nabla({\mathrm{P}\mathrm{P}\mathbf{N}}^{\mathbf{N}}),\leq_{\mathrm{lo}})$ to be the preorders induced by the maps $\mathrm{mo}_{(-)},\mathrm{lo}_{(-)}:\nabla({\mathrm{P}\mathrm{P}\mathbf{N}}^{% \mathbf{N}})\rightarrow\mathrm{Mo},\mathrm{Lo}$ respectively.
Definition. A preassembly is a pair $(X,E)$, where $X$ is a set and $E$ is a function $X\rightarrow{\mathrm{P}\mathbf{N}}$. The function $E$ is called the encoding function. Given $x\in X$, a number $\in E(x)$ is called a code or index of $x$. A preassembly $(X,E)$ for which $E(x)\neq\emptyset$ for all $x\in X$ is called an assembly.4The assemblies form a full subcategory of the effective topos with rich structure, but we do not discuss this here. Our interest now is just in having a rigorous notion of effectivity of functions between sets other than powers of $\mathbf{N}$.
Definition 1.1.3. A Heyting prealgebra is a preorder, that is (considered as a category) cartesian closed and has finite coproducts. A morphism of Heyting prealgebras is a function that preserves all the structures up to isomorphism. We denote by $\mathbf{Heytpre}$ the preorder-enriched category of Heyting prealgebras and their morphisms, with pointwise preordering on the hom collections. A Heyting prealgebra with specific structure is a tuple $(H,\leq,\wedge,\vee,\Rightarrow,0,1)$ where $(H,\leq)$ is a Heyting prealgebra and $\wedge,\vee,\Rightarrow,0,1$ are operations on $H$ for meet, join, Heyting implication, bottom and top respectively.
Definition 1.2.26. Let $(P,\leq)$ be a Heyting prealgebra. A function $j:P\rightarrow P$ is a closure operator on $P$ if one of the following two (constructively) equivalent conditions $\begin{array}[]{rlccrl}(i)&\top\leq j(\top)&&&(i^{\prime})&p\leq j(p)\\ (ii)&j(p\wedge q)\cong j(p)\wedge j(q)&&&(ii^{\prime})&j(p\Rightarrow q)\leq(j% (p)\Rightarrow j(q))\\ (iii)&j(j(p))\cong j(p)&&&(iii^{\prime})&j(j(p))\leq j(p).\end{array}$ are satisfied.15The use of stating two characterizations is obvious: when proving that something is a closure operator we can choose one of the two, and when proving something given a closure operator we can use the properties from both characterizations.
Definition 3.2.6. A node $s$ of a sight is degenerate if the subsight at $s$ is $(\emptyset,\emptyset)$. A sight is degenerate if it has a degenerate node, i.e. it has a subsight equal to $(\emptyset,\emptyset)$.
Definition 3.6.1. A sight $S$ is a sector of a sight $T$ when, by induction on $S$, • if $S=\mathrm{Nil}$, then $T=\mathrm{Nil}$, • if $S=(A,\sigma)$, then $T=(B,\tau)$ with $A\subseteq B$ and for each $a\in A$ the sight $\sigma(a)$ is a sector of $\tau(a)$. A sight $S$ is finitary when, inductively, • if $S=\mathrm{Nil}$, then always, • if $S=(A,\sigma)$, then $A$ is finite and for each $a\in A$ the sight $\sigma(a)$ is finitary. For $n\in\mathbf{N}$, a sight $s$ is full $n$-ary when, inductively, • if $S=\mathrm{Nil}$, then always, • if $S=(A,\sigma)$, then $|A|=n$ and for all $a\in A$ the sight $\sigma(a)$ is full $n$-ary.
Definition 3.1.2. Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a cartesian closed category, and let $P$ be a $\mathcal{C}$-tripos. Given a term $h:\Sigma^{\Sigma}$ in the language of $P$, we define a $P$-formula $\mathrm{mon}(h):=\forall p,q^{\Sigma}.(p\Rightarrow q)\Rightarrow(h(p)% \Rightarrow h(q)).$ Let $h:\Sigma\rightarrow\Sigma$ be a morphism in $\mathcal{C}$. We say that $h$ is monotone if $P\models\mathrm{mon}(h)$. Note that $h$ is monotone if and only if it represents a monotone map $\Omega\rightarrow\Omega$.
Definition 3.2.20. Let $w:\mathbf{N}^{*}\rightharpoonup\mathbf{N}$ be a partial function, let $\theta\in{\mathrm{P}\mathrm{P}\mathbf{N}}^{\mathbf{N}}$ and let $p\in{\mathrm{P}\mathbf{N}}$. We say that a sight $S$ is $(w,\theta,p)$-supporting if • for each leaf $s\in\mathrm{Nds}(S)$, we have $w(s)=\langle 0,y\rangle$ with $y\in p$, and • for each non-leaf $s\in\mathrm{Nds}(S)$, we have $w(s)=\langle 1,n\rangle$ with $\mathrm{Out}_{S}(s)\in\theta(n)$. We say that $S$ is $(w,\theta)$-supporting if $S$ is $(w,\theta,\mathbf{N})$-supporting.
Definition. The language of arithmetic is the untyped language consisting of a constant symbol $0$ and a unary function symbol $\mathrm{suc}$.
Definition 3.2.16. Let $T$ be a well-founded tree. The foundation number of $T$, to be denoted $\mathrm{fn}(T)$, is the least length of a leaf of $T$.
Definition. Let $X,Y$ be preassemblies, and let $f:X\rightharpoonup Y$ be a partial function. We say that a partial recursive function $\phi:\mathbf{N}\rightharpoonup\mathbf{N}$ tracks $f$ (or that $\phi$ is a tracking of $f$) if for all $x\in\mathrm{Dom}(f)$ and $d\in E(x)$ we have $\phi(d)\textnormal{\textdownarrow}$ and $\phi(d)\in E(f(x))$. We say that $f$ is computable (or effective) if $f$ has a tracking.
Definition 3.2.3. A sight is, inductively, • either: something called $\mathrm{Nil}$, • or: a pair $(A,\sigma)$ where $A\in{\mathrm{P}\mathbf{N}}$ and $\sigma(a)$ is a sight for each $a\in A$. Given $\theta\in{\mathrm{P}\mathrm{P}\mathbf{N}}^{\mathbf{N}}$, $z\in\mathbf{N}$ and $p\in{\mathrm{P}\mathbf{N}}$, a sight $S$ is $(z,\theta,p)$-dedicated if, by induction on $S$, • in case $S=\mathrm{Nil}$: $z=\langle 0,y\rangle$ with $y\in p$, • in case $S=(A,\sigma)$: (i) $z=\langle 1,\langle n,e\rangle\rangle$ for some $n,e\in\mathbf{N}$, (ii) $A\in\theta(n)$, (iii) $e$ is defined on $A$, and (iv) for each $a\in A$ the sight $\sigma(a)$ is $(e(a),\theta,p)$-dedicated. We say that $S$ is $(z,\theta)$-dedicated if $S$ is $(z,\theta,\mathbf{N})$-dedicated.
Definition 3.4.8. In a topos $\mathcal{E}$, let $(D,g):X\rightharpoonup Y$ be a partial map, and let $U\in\mathrm{Sub}(X)$. We say that the partial map $(D,g)$ is defined on $U$ if $U\leq D$ in $\mathrm{Sub}(X)$. Let $j$ be a local operator on $\mathcal{E}$. We say that the partial map $(D,g)$ is defined on $U$ in $j$ if the partial map $(\mathbf{a}(D),\mathbf{a}(g))$ is defined on $\mathbf{a}(U)$ in $\mathrm{Sh}_{j}(\mathcal{E})$.
Definition 2.2.4. Internally in a topos, let $D$ be a subset of $\Omega$. We say that $D$ is upwards closed if for all $p\in D$ and $q\in\Omega$ if $p\leq q$ then $q\in D$, i.e. if the characteristic function $\chi_{D}:\Omega\rightarrow\Omega$ of $D$ is monotone.
Definition 1.1.6. The notion of language we will consider depends on a category, which serves as a means of specifying the types and the function symbols in the language. Having this in mind, let $\mathcal{C}$ be a category with finite products. A $\mathcal{C}$-typed (first-order) language (without equality) consists merely of a collection of typed relation symbols, with as types the objects of $\mathcal{C}$. The function symbols are the arrows in $\mathcal{C}$. Terms and formulas are defined as usual in (finitary) logic, respecting the modifiers ‘$\mathcal{C}$-typed’, ‘first-order’ and ‘without equality’ appearing in the name for our notion of language. The interpretation of a term is defined in the obvious way as an arrow of $\mathcal{C}$. Given a term $t:(X_{1},\ldots,X_{n})\rightarrow Y$, we will denote its interpretation $X_{1}\times\ldots\times X_{n}\rightarrow Y$ just by $t$. From now on, suppose that $\mathcal{C}$ is cartesian closed. Let $P$ be a $\mathcal{C}$-tripos. Given a $\mathcal{C}$-typed language $\mathcal{L}$, an interpretation of $\mathcal{L}$ in $P$ associates to each relation symbol $r$ in $\mathcal{L}$ on a tuple $(X_{1},\ldots,X_{n})$ of types an element $\llbracket r\rrbracket\in P(X_{1}\times\ldots\times X_{n})$. Depending on an interpretation of $\mathcal{L}$ in $P$, the interpretation of a formula $\phi(x_{1}^{X_{1}},\ldots,x_{n}^{X_{n}})$ is defined as an element $\llbracket\phi\rrbracket\in P$ by induction on $\phi$ in the obvious way, with the following as the clause for the atomic case: given a relation symbol $r$ on some $(Y_{1},\ldots,Y_{m})$ and $m$ terms $t_{1},\ldots,t_{m}:(X_{1},\ldots,X_{n})\rightarrow Y_{1},\ldots,Y_{m}$, we put $\llbracket r(t_{1},\ldots,t_{m})\rrbracket=P(t_{1},\ldots,t_{m})(\llbracket r\rrbracket)$.2In the last expression, ‘$(t_{1},\ldots,t_{m})$’ denotes the induced $\mathcal{C}$-morphism $X_{1}\times\ldots\times X_{n}\rightarrow Y_{1}\times\ldots\times Y_{m}$. The notation $\llbracket\cdot\rrbracket$ may also be written as $\llbracket^{P}\cdot\rrbracket$ for indicating in which tripos the language is interpreted. Depending on an interpretation of $\mathcal{L}$ in $P$, given a formula $\phi$ in $\mathcal{L}$, we say that $\phi$ is true in $P$, and write $P\models\phi$, if $\llbracket\phi\rrbracket\in P(1)$ is a top element. We have soundness: for $\mathcal{L}$ a $\mathcal{C}$-typed language and an interpretation of $\mathcal{L}$ in $P$, given a formula $\phi$ in $\mathcal{L}$, if $\phi$ can be proved in the intuitionistic predicate calculus, then $P\models\phi$.3Cf. [Oos08, Theorem 2.1.6]. There is a “universal” language associated to a $\mathcal{C}$-tripos $P$: its collection of relations symbols are all the elements of the preorders $P(X)$. This language is called the language of $P$, and obviously its relation symbols can be interpreted as themselves.
Definition 3.1.17. Consider the following diagram of maps in $\mathbf{Eff}$, where the unnamed maps are obvious canonical maps. Clearly everything commutes. {diagram} & & ∇(PPN) & \rTogr_(-) & Ω^Ω & \ldImtoΔ_(-) & \dImto& & \dImto& \rdEq ∇(PPN^N) & ≅id & ∇(PPN)^N & \rDoto& (Ω^Ω)^N & \rTo∨ & Ω^Ω& \rOnto(-)^mo & Mo& \rOnto(-)^lo/mo & Lo Note that by Proposition 3.1.7, the composite map $\nabla({\mathrm{P}\mathrm{P}\mathbf{N}})^{N}\rightarrow\Omega^{\Omega}$ is an epi.

Internally in $\mathbf{Eff}$, given $\theta\in\nabla({\mathrm{P}\mathrm{P}\mathbf{N}}^{\mathbf{N}})$, we call $\mathrm{lo}_{\theta}$ the local operator associated to $\theta$.
Definition 1.3.1. The effective topos is the topos $\mathbf{Eff}:=\mathbf{Set}[\mathbf{ET}]$.
Definition 3.6.18. Let $n\in\mathbf{N}$. Let $(d_{1},\ldots,d_{q})\in\mathbf{N}^{*}$ with $q<k$. We define a number $b_{n}(d_{1},\ldots,d_{q})\in\mathbf{N}$ as follows. (i) If $q$ is odd and $\mathbf{N}\models\exists x_{q+1}\forall x_{q+2}\ldots\exists x_{k}\phi(n,d_{1}% ,\ldots,d_{q},x_{q+1},\ldots,x_{k})$, let $b_{n}(d_{1},\ldots,d_{q})$ be the least $y$ such that $\mathbf{N}\models\forall x_{q+2}\ldots\forall x_{k-1}\exists x_{k}\phi(n,d_{1}% ,\ldots,d_{q},y,x_{q+2},\ldots,x_{k})$. (ii) If $q$ is odd and $\mathbf{N}\not\models\exists x_{q+1}\forall x_{q+2}\ldots\exists x_{k}\phi(n,d% _{1},\ldots,d_{q},x_{q+1},\ldots,x_{k})$, let $b_{n}(d_{1},\ldots,d_{q})=0$. (iii) If $q$ is even and $\mathbf{N}\models\forall x_{q+1}\exists x_{q+2}\ldots\forall x_{k-1}\exists x_% {k}\phi(n,d_{1},\ldots,y_{q},x_{q+1},\ldots,x_{k})$, let $b_{n}(d_{1},\ldots,d_{q})=0$. (iv) If $q$ is even and $\mathbf{N}\not\models\forall x_{q+1}\exists x_{q+2}\ldots\forall x_{k-1}% \exists x_{k}\phi(n,d_{1},\ldots,y_{q},x_{q+1},\ldots,x_{k})$, let $b_{n}(_{1},\ldots,d_{q})$ be the least $y\in\mathbf{N}$ such that $\mathbf{N}\not\models\exists x_{q+2}\ldots\forall x_{k-1}\exists x_{k}\phi(n,d% _{1},\ldots,d_{q},y,x_{q+2},\ldots,x_{k})$.
Definition 3.2.9. Let $z\in\mathbf{N}$, and let $s=(x_{1},\ldots,x_{k})\in\mathbf{N}^{*}$. The r-value of $s$ under $z$, denoted $z[s]$, is sometimes defined, by induction on $k$, as follows. • (case $k=0$) For it to exist, we must have $z=\langle 0,y\rangle$. If so, it is $y$. • (case $k>0$) For it to exist, we must have that (i) $z=\langle 1,\langle\_,e\rangle\rangle$, (ii) $e$ is defined on $x_{1}$, and (iii) the r-value of $(x_{2},\ldots,x_{k})$ under $e(x_{1})$ exists. If so, it is the r-value of $(x_{2},\ldots,x_{k})$ under $e(x_{1})$. We say that $z$ is r-defined on $s$ if the r-value of $s$ under $z$ exists.
Definition 1.25. A monad on a category ${\mathcal{C}}$ is a triple ${\mathbb{T}}=(T,\delta,\psi)$ consisting of a covariant functor $T:{\mathcal{C}}\to{\mathcal{C}}$ and natural transformations $\delta:Id\to T$ (identity) and $\psi:T^{2}\to T$ (multiplication) which satisfy the following conditions: $\psi\circ T\delta=\psi\circ\delta T=\operatorname{id}_{T}\quad\text{è}\quad% \psi\circ\psi T=\psi\circ T\psi.$ A functor $T$ that can be included in a triple $\mathbb{T}$ is called monadic in the category ${\mathcal{C}}$.
Definition 2.1 ([3]) • Let $\Omega=(n_{\lambda})_{\lambda\in I}$ be a class of cardinal numbers. An $\Omega$-algebra is a pair $(A,(\omega_{\lambda}^{A})_{\lambda\in I})$ consisting of a set $A$ and a family of maps $\omega_{\lambda}^{A}:A^{n_{\lambda}}\rightarrow A$. Any $B(\neq\phi)\subseteq A$ is called a subalgebra of $(A,(\omega_{\lambda}^{A})_{\lambda\in I})$ if for any $\lambda\in I$ and any $(b_{i})_{i\in n_{\lambda}}\in B^{n_{\lambda}}$, $\omega_{\lambda}^{A}((b_{i})_{i\in n_{\lambda}})\in B$. Given $S\subseteq A$, the intersection of all the subalgebras of $(A,(\omega_{\lambda}^{A})_{\lambda\in I})$ containing $S$ is clearly a subalgebra of $(A,(\omega_{\lambda}^{A})_{\lambda\in I})$. We shall denote it as $<S>$. • Given $(A,(\omega_{\lambda}^{A})_{\lambda\in I})$ and $(B,(\omega_{\lambda}^{B})_{\lambda\in I})$, a map $f:A\rightarrow B$ is called an $\Omega$-algebra homomorphism if for every $\lambda\in I$ the following diagram commutes: $\xymatrix{A^{n_{\lambda}}\ar[d]_{\omega_{\lambda}^{A}}\ar[r]^{f^{n_{\lambda}}}% &B^{n_{\lambda}}\ar[d]^{\omega_{\lambda}^{B}}\\ A\ar[r]_{f}&B}$ . Let ${\bf Alg}(\Omega)$ denote the category of $\Omega$-algebras and $\Omega$-algebra homomorphisms. • A variety of $\Omega$-algebras is a full subcategory of ${\bf Alg}(\Omega)$ which is closed under the formation of products 1The category ${\bf Alg}(\Omega)$ is closed under products, subalgebras and homomorphic images. Throughout, $Q$ denotes a fixed member of a fixed variety of $\Omega$-algebras. • Given a set $X$, a subset $\tau$ of $Q^{X}$ is called a $Q$-topology on $X$ if $\tau$ is a subalgebra of $Q^{X}$; in such a case, the pair $(X,\tau)$ is called a $Q$-topological space. • Given two $Q$-topological spaces $(X,\tau)$ and $(Y,\eta)$, a $Q$-continuous function from $(X,\tau)$ to $(Y,\eta)$ is a function $f:X\rightarrow Y$ such that $f^{\leftarrow}(\alpha)\in\tau,\forall\alpha\in\eta$, where $f^{\leftarrow}(\alpha)=\alpha\circ f$.
Definition 2.2 ([2]) 1. A category $C$ of sets with structure is defined through the following descriptions of its objects (‘$C$-structured sets’) and morphisms (‘$C$-admissible maps’), satisfying the two axioms given below: A class $C(X)$ of ‘$C$-structures’ is assigned with each set $X$ and a ‘$C$-structured set’ is a pair $(X,s)$, with $s\in C(X)$. A subset $C(s,t)$ of the set of all functions from $X$ to $Y$ is assigned with each pair of $C$-structured sets $(X,s)$ and $(Y,t)$ and a ‘$C$-admissible map’ from $(X,s)$ to $(Y,t)$ is any $f\in C(s,t)$ (in which case we write “$f:(X,s)\rightarrow(Y,t)$”). The axioms are: Axiom $A_{1}$: If $f:(X,s)\rightarrow(Y,t)$ and $g:(Y,t)\rightarrow(Z,u)$ then also $g\circ f:(X,s)\rightarrow(Z,u)$. Axiom $A_{2}$: Given a bijection $f:X\rightarrow Y$ and $t\in C(Y)$, there exists a unique $s\in C(X)$ such that $f:(X,s)\rightarrow(Y,t)$ and $f^{-1}:(Y,t)\rightarrow(X,s)$. 2. Given a category ${\bf C}$ of structures (as defined above), a family ${\cal F}=\{f_{j}:(X,s)\rightarrow(Y_{j},t_{j})|j\in J\}$ of $C$-admissible maps is said to be optimal if for each $C$-structured set $(Z,u)$ and a function $g:Z\rightarrow X$, $g:(Z,u)\rightarrow(X,s)$ iff $f_{j}\circ g:(Z,u)\rightarrow(X,s),\forall j\in J$. Further, if for a family ${\cal F}=\{f_{j}:X\rightarrow(Y_{j},t_{j})|j\in J\}$ of functions, where $X$ is a set and each $(Y_{j},t_{j})$ is a $C$-structured set, there exists $s\in C(X)$ such that the family $\{f_{j}:(X,s)\rightarrow(Y_{j},t_{j})|j\in J\}$ is optimal, then $s$ is called an optimal lift of the family ${\cal F}$. 3. An object $S=(S,u)$ in a category $C$ of sets with structure is called a Sierpinski object if for every $C$-object $X=(X,s)$, the family of all $C$-admissible maps from $X$ to $S$ is optimal.
Definition 4. Let $X\in\mbox{\bf Top}$. A subset element $(U,I)$ is called negligible if, in the subset topology, $U\in\mbox{\bf LC}$ and $I$ is a negligible subset of $U$. Let $f:X\longrightarrow Y$ be a continuous function between two locally connected spaces. We say $f$ is diffuse if $f$ pulls back each negligible subset element of $Y$ to a negligible subset elements of $X$.
Definition 1. Let $X\in\mbox{\bf LC}$. An open subset $U$ of $X$ is called Z-dense (in $X$) if, for every non-empty open connected subset $C$ of $X$, $U\cap C$ is non-empty and connected. (One may regard these as a generalization of sets which are dense in a Zariski topology, as used in algebraic geometry.) A subset $I\subseteq X$ is called negligible (in $X$) if its complement is Z-dense.
