Definition 3.4. A (left) curved module over a curved dg-algebra is a $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ graded (left) module over $A$ together with an odd derivation $d$ such that $d^{2}=w.$
Definition 2.2. A dg-algebra $A$ is of finite type if it is a homotopy retract in the homotopy category of dg-algebras of a free algebra $(\mathbb{C}\langle v_{1},v_{2},\ldots,v_{n}\rangle,d)$ with $dv_{j}\in\mathbb{C}\langle v_{1},v_{2},\ldots,v_{j-1}\rangle$
Definition 3.5. We denote by $B-proj$ the $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ graded dg-subcategory of $B-mod$ consisting of modules $M$ whose underlying graded modules $M^{\sharp}$ are projective. We define $Ho(B-proj)$ to be its homotopy category.
Definition 3.3. A triple $B=(A,w,d)$ consisting of a $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ graded algebra $A$, a function of even degree $w$, and an derivation $d$ of odd degree is called a graded curved dg-algebra if $d^{2}=[w,a]$
7.1 Definition. For any two multicategories, ${\mathcal{P}}$ and $\operatorname{\mathtt{Q}}$, a ${\mathcal{P}}$-$\operatorname{\mathtt{Q}}$-bimodule is consists of an object $M$ in $\operatorname{Coll}(\operatorname{\mathcal{C}})_{\operatorname{obj}({\mathcal{% P}})\times\operatorname{obj}(\operatorname{\mathtt{Q}})}$ which has a left ${\mathcal{P}}$ action and a compatible right $\operatorname{\mathtt{Q}}$ action: • for each $a_{1},\ldots,a_{n}\in\operatorname{\mathtt{Q}}$ and each $b\in{\mathcal{P}}$, an $\operatorname{\mathcal{M}}$-object $M(a_{1},\ldots,a_{n};b)$ • for each $a_{i}^{j}\in\operatorname{\mathtt{Q}}$ and $b_{i},b\in{\mathcal{P}}$, a left ${\mathcal{P}}$-action ($\operatorname{\mathcal{M}}$-morphism) $\displaystyle\begin{array}[b]{r}{\mathcal{P}}(b_{1},\ldots,b_{n};b)\otimes M(a% _{1}^{1},\ldots,a_{1}^{k_{1}};b_{1})\otimes\cdots\\ \otimes M(a_{n}^{1},\ldots,a_{n}^{k_{n}};b_{n})\end{array}$ $\displaystyle\rightarrow$ $\displaystyle M(a_{1}^{1},\ldots,a_{n}^{k_{n}};b),$ $\displaystyle(\phi,\xi_{1},\ldots,\xi_{n})$ $\displaystyle\mapsto$ $\displaystyle\phi\cdot(\xi_{1},\ldots,\xi_{n})$ • for each $a_{i}^{j},a_{i}\in\operatorname{\mathtt{Q}}$ and each $b\in{\mathcal{P}}$, a right $\operatorname{\mathtt{Q}}$-action ($\operatorname{\mathcal{M}}$-morphism) $\displaystyle\begin{array}[b]{r}M(a_{1},\ldots,a_{n};b)\otimes\operatorname{% \mathtt{Q}}(a_{1}^{1},\ldots,a_{1}^{k_{1}};a_{1})\otimes\cdots\\ \otimes\operatorname{\mathtt{Q}}(a_{n}^{1},\ldots,a_{n}^{k_{n}};a_{n})\end{array}$ $\displaystyle\rightarrow$ $\displaystyle M(a_{1}^{1},\ldots,a_{n}^{k_{n}};b),$ $\displaystyle(\xi,\theta_{1},\ldots,\theta_{n})$ $\displaystyle\mapsto$ $\displaystyle\xi\cdot(\theta_{1},\ldots,\theta_{n}),$ which satisfy the evident axioms for compatibility with the composition products and identities of both $\operatorname{\mathtt{Q}}$ and ${\mathcal{P}}$, in addition to: $(\phi\cdot(\xi_{1},\ldots,\xi_{n}))\cdot(\theta_{1}^{1},\ldots,\theta_{n}^{k_{% n}})=\phi\cdot(\xi_{1}\cdot(\theta_{1}^{1},\ldots,\theta_{1}^{k_{1}}),\ldots,% \xi_{n}\cdot(\theta_{n}^{1},\ldots,\theta_{n}^{k_{n}}))$ whenever these expressions make sense.
3.2 Definition. [EM06] Let ${\mathcal{P}}$, $\operatorname{\mathtt{Q}}$, and $\operatorname{\mathtt{R}}$ be multicategories. A bilinear map $f:({\mathcal{P}},\operatorname{\mathtt{Q}})\to\operatorname{\mathtt{R}}$ consists of the following data: (1) A function $f:\operatorname{obj}({\mathcal{P}})\times\operatorname{obj}(\operatorname{% \mathtt{Q}})\to\operatorname{obj}(\operatorname{\mathtt{R}})$, (2) For each $m$-ary operation $\phi\in{\mathcal{P}}(a_{1},\ldots,a_{m};a)$ of ${\mathcal{P}}$ and each object $b$ of $\operatorname{\mathtt{Q}}$, an $m$-ary operation $f(\phi,b)\in\operatorname{\mathtt{R}}(f(a_{1},b),\ldots,f(a_{m},b);f(a,b))$ of $\operatorname{\mathtt{R}}$, (3) For each $n$-ary operation $\psi\in\operatorname{\mathtt{Q}}(b_{1},\ldots,b_{n};b)$ of $\operatorname{\mathtt{Q}}$ and object $a$ of ${\mathcal{P}}$, an $n$-operation $f(a,\psi)\in\operatorname{\mathtt{R}}(f(a,b_{1}),\ldots,f(a,b_{n});f(a,b))$ of $\operatorname{\mathtt{R}}$ such that: (1) For each object $a$ of ${\mathcal{P}}$, $f(a,-)$ is a multifunctor from $\operatorname{\mathtt{Q}}$ to $\operatorname{\mathtt{R}}$, (2) For each object $b$ of $\operatorname{\mathtt{Q}}$, $f(-,b)$ is a multifunctor from ${\mathcal{P}}$ to $\operatorname{\mathtt{R}}$, (3) Given an $m$-operation $\phi\in{\mathcal{P}}(a_{1},\ldots,a_{m};a)$ and an $n$-operation $\psi\in\operatorname{\mathtt{Q}}(b_{1},\ldots,b_{n};b)$ in $\operatorname{\mathtt{Q}}$, the following diagram commutes: $\xymatrix{\{\{f(a_{i},b_{j})\}_{i=1}^{m}\}_{j=1}^{n}\ar[r]^{-}{\{f(\phi,b_{j})% \}}\ar[d]_{-}{\cong}&\{f(a,b_{j})\}_{j=1}^{n}\ar[dd]^{-}{f(a,\psi)}\\ \{\{f(a_{i},b_{j})\}_{j=1}^{n}\}_{i=1}^{m}\ar[d]_{-}{\{f(a_{i},\psi)\}}\\ \{f(a_{i},b)\}_{i=1}^{m}\ar[r]_{-}{f(\phi,b)}&f(a,b).}$ The set of bilinear maps is denoted as $\textrm{Bilin}({\mathcal{P}},\operatorname{\mathtt{Q}};\operatorname{\mathtt{R% }})$.
2.1 Definition. Let ${\mathcal{P}}$ and $\operatorname{\mathtt{Q}}$ be two multicategories. A multifunctor $F:{\mathcal{P}}\rightarrow\operatorname{\mathtt{Q}}$ is essentially surjective if $[F]_{1}$ is essentially surjective as a functor of categories. We say that $F$ is full if for any sequence $p_{1},...,p_{n},p$ the function $F:{\mathcal{P}}(p_{1},...,p_{n};p)\rightarrow\operatorname{\mathtt{Q}}(Fp_{1},% ...,Fp_{n};Fp)$ is surjective. We say that $F$ is faithful if for any sequence $p_{1},...,p_{n},p$ the function $F:{\mathcal{P}}(p_{1},...,p_{n};p)\rightarrow\operatorname{\mathtt{Q}}(Fp_{1},% ...,Fp_{n};Fp)$ is injective. The multifunctor $F$ is called fully faithful if it is both full and faithful.
3.1 Definition. [EM06, Definition 2.2] For notational convenience, we denote the sequence $c_{1},\dots,c_{k}$ as $\{c_{i}\}_{i=1}^{k}$. Given symmetric multicategories ${\mathcal{P}}$ and $\operatorname{\mathtt{Q}}$, we define $\underline{\operatorname{\mathit{Hom}}}({\mathcal{P}},\operatorname{\mathtt{Q}})$ to be a multicategory with objects the multifunctors from ${\mathcal{P}}$ to $\operatorname{\mathtt{Q}}$. Given a sequence of multifunctors $F_{1},\ldots,F_{k}:{\mathcal{P}}\rightarrow\operatorname{\mathtt{Q}}$ of multifunctors and a target multifunctor $G:{\mathcal{P}}\rightarrow\operatorname{\mathtt{Q}}$, we define a $k$-natural transformation from $F_{1},\ldots,F_{k}$ to $G$ to be a function $\xi$ that assigns to each object $a$ of ${\mathcal{P}}$ a $k$-operation $\xi_{a}:(F_{1}a,\ldots,F_{k}a)\to Ga$ of $\operatorname{\mathtt{Q}}$, such that for any $m$-ary operation $\phi:(a_{1},\ldots,a_{m})\to b$ in ${\mathcal{P}}$, the following diagram commutes: $\xymatrix{\{\{F_{j}a_{i}\}_{j=1}^{k}\}_{i=1}^{m}\ar[r]^{-}{\{\xi_{a_{i}}\}}\ar% [d]_{-}{\cong}&\{Ga_{i}\}_{i=1}^{m}\ar[dd]^{-}{G\phi}\\ \{\{F_{j}a_{i}\}_{i=1}^{m}\}_{j=1}^{k}\ar[d]_{-}{\{F_{j}\phi\}}\\ \{F_{j}b\}_{j=1}^{k}\ar[r]_{-}{\xi_{b}}&Gb.}$ The unlabelled isomorphism is the standard block permutation that shuffles $m$ blocks of $k$ entries each into $k$ blocks of $m$ entries each. The $k$-natural transformations form the $k$-ary operations in the multicategory $\underline{\operatorname{\mathit{Hom}}}({\mathcal{P}},\operatorname{\mathtt{Q}})$. Composition and symmetric actions are induced by the composition and symmetric actions in $\operatorname{\mathtt{Q}}$.
3.18 Definition. A right $\operatorname{\mathtt{Q}}$-module $M$ is pointed if it comes with a unit map $\operatorname{\mathtt{Q}}=\operatorname{\mathbf{1}}\circ\operatorname{\mathtt{% Q}}\longrightarrow M\circ\operatorname{\mathtt{Q}}\longrightarrow M.$ A pointed right $\operatorname{\mathtt{Q}}$-module $M$ will be called quasi-free if the natural map $\operatorname{\mathtt{Q}}\longrightarrow\operatorname{\mathit{End}}_{% \operatorname{\mathtt{Q}}}(M)$ is weak equivalence of right $\operatorname{\mathtt{Q}}$-modules. We will say that a ${\mathcal{P}}$-$\operatorname{\mathtt{Q}}$-bimodule is pointed (respectively, right quasi-free) if it is pointed (respectively, quasi-free) as a right $\operatorname{\mathtt{Q}}$-module.
2.2 Definition. Let $F:{\mathcal{P}}\rightarrow\operatorname{\mathtt{Q}}$ be a functor between two symmetric multicategories. We say that $F$ is an equivalence of multicategories if, and only if, $F$ is both fully faithful and essentially surjective.
Definition 2.1.7. Let $\mathfrak{M}$ be a pointed formal set over $\mathbold{X}$ (as above). A $\mathfrak{M}$-scheme is a scheme $\mathbold{Z}$ over $\mathbold{X}$, together with a map $\mathfrak{M}\times_{\mathbold}{X}\mathbold{Z}\xrightarrow{}\mathbold{Z}$ over $\mathbold{X}$, such that the induced map $\mathbold{Z}\xrightarrow{}\mathbold{Z}$ resulting from the point is the identity. If $\mathfrak{M}$ is a formal abelian monoid, an iterative $\mathfrak{M}$-scheme is an $\mathfrak{M}$-scheme in which the structure map is a monoid action (when $\mathfrak{M}$ is such a monoid, all $\mathfrak{M}$-schemes we will consider will be iterative, so we will usually omit the title “iterative”). If $\mathbold{Z}$ is an (iterative) $\mathfrak{M}$-scheme, an (iterative) $\mathfrak{M}$-scheme over $\mathbold{Z}$ is a map of (iterative) $\mathfrak{M}$-schemes $\mathbold{W}\xrightarrow{}\mathbold{Z}$.
Definition 3.3.1. Let $(\mathcal{C},\tau,a,b)$ be an $E$-tensor category, $\mathit{X}$ an algebra in $\mathcal{C}$. An $E$-structure on $\mathit{X}$ consists of an algebra map $d:\tau(\mathit{X})\xrightarrow{}\mathit{X}$, such that $d\circ{}a_{\mathit{X}}$ is the identity, and the following diagram commutes $\xymatrix{\tau\tau\mathit{X}\ar[rr]^{\tau(d)}\ar[d]_{b_{\mathit{X}}}&&\tau% \mathit{X}\ar[d]^{d}\\ m^{!}\tau\mathit{X}\ar[r]_{m}&\tau\mathit{X}\ar[r]_{d}&\mathit{X}}$ The category of (affine) $\mathfrak{M}_{0}$-schemes in $\mathcal{C}$ is the opposite of the category of algebras with $E$-structure (and maps of between them that preserve this structure)
Definition 1.3.2. Let $\pi:\mathcal{C}\xrightarrow{}\mathcal{I}$ be a fibred category. The inverse limit $\underset{\mathcal{I}}{\varprojlim}\,\mathcal{C}$ is the category of Cartesian functors from $\mathcal{I}$ to $\mathcal{C}$.
Definition 3.1.1. Let $\mathbold{G}$ be an $\mathfrak{M}$-group. A representation of $\mathbold{G}$ is a map (of $\mathfrak{M}$-groups) $\mathbold{G}\xrightarrow{}\tau\mathbold{GL}(V)$ for some finite dimensional $\Bbbk$-vector space $V$. As customary, we sometimes write $V$ for the whole representation. A representation is faithful if it is a closed embedding. The group $\mathbold{G}$ is linear if it admit a faithful representation.
Definition 3.4.3. We say that an $\mathfrak{M}$-field $\Bbbk$ is $\mathfrak{M}$-closed if any non-empty $\mathfrak{M}$-pro-variety over $\Bbbk$ that can be given by a $<\!\!\kappa$-system of varieties, has a $\Bbbk$-point (i.e., an $\mathfrak{M}$-morphism from $\operatorname{spec}(\Bbbk)$).
Definition 2.2.11. Let $\mathfrak{M}$ be a formal monoid acting on a scheme $\mathbold{Z}$, and let $\mathbold{W}$ be a quasi-projective scheme over $\mathbold{Z}$. A $\mathfrak{M}$-subscheme of $\mathbold{W}$ is a closed subscheme of $\tau\mathbold{W}$ that is closed under the action. In other words, it is an $\mathfrak{M}$ pro-scheme $\mathbold{W}_{1}$ over $\mathbold{W}$, such that the induced map $\mathbold{W}_{1}\xrightarrow{}\tau\mathbold{W}$ is a closed embedding.
Definition 3.2.4. With notation as above. (1) An $E_{0}$-structure (or $\mathfrak{M}_{0}$-structure) on a $\Bbbk$-linear tensor category $\mathcal{C}$ consists of the following data: (a) A $\Bbbk_{0}$-linear tensor functor $\tau$ from $\mathcal{C}$ to $\mathcal{C}^{(E)}$, which is exact when viewed as a functor into $E\!-\!\mathcal{C}$. (b) A $\Bbbk$-linear tensor isomorphism $\mathbbm{a}:i^{!}\circ\tau\xrightarrow{}Id_{\mathcal{C}}$ (c) An $E\otimes_{\Bbbk}{}E$-linear tensor isomorphism $\mathbbm{b}:\tau\circ\tau\xrightarrow{}m^{!}\circ\tau$ An $E_{0}$-tensor category is a $\Bbbk$-linear tensor category together with an $E_{0}$-structure. (2) If $(\mathcal{C},\tau,\mathbbm{a},\mathbbm{b})$ and $(\mathcal{D},\sigma,\mathbbm{c},\mathbbm{d})$ are $E_{0}$-tensor categories (where $\mathcal{D}$ is allowed to be over a different field $K$), an $E_{0}$-functor from the first to the second consists of an exact $\Bbbk$-linear tensor functor $\mathscr{F}:\mathcal{C}\xrightarrow{}\mathcal{D}$, together with an $E$-linear tensor isomorphism $u$: $\xymatrix{\mathcal{C}\ar[r]^{\mathscr{F}}\ar[d]_{\tau}&\mathcal{D}\ar[d]^{% \sigma}\ar@{=>}[dl]_{u}\\ \mathcal{C}^{(E)}\ar[r]_{\mathscr{F}^{(E)}}&\mathcal{D}^{(E)}}$ This data is required to satisfy the obvious commutation relation with the structure isomorphism: The diagrams commute. (3) If $(\mathscr{F},u)$ and $(\mathscr{G},v)$ are $E_{0}$-functors from $(\mathcal{C},\dots)$ to $(\mathcal{D},\dots)$, an $E_{0}$-map from $(\mathscr{F},u)$ to $(\mathscr{G},v)$ is a ($K$-linear) map $\mathbbm{r}:\mathscr{F}\xrightarrow{}\mathscr{G}$ of tensor functors, such that the diagram $\xymatrix$ F(τX)\ar[d]^r_τX Remark 3.2.5. A functor $\tau$ as in the definition determines a functor ${{\tau}^{\vee}}:\mathit{X}\mapsto{{(\tau({{\mathit{X}}^{\vee}}))}^{\vee}}$, which is a tensor functor into $\mathcal{C}_{(E)}$ (by Corollary 1.3.10), and this process determines an equivalence between the two kinds of tensor functors. Further, an $E_{0}$-tensor functor determines, in an obvious manner, an isomorphism ${{u}^{\vee}}:{{\sigma}^{\vee}}\circ\mathscr{F}\xrightarrow{}\mathscr{F}\circ{{% \tau}^{\vee}}$ (in the terminology of the definition). Hence, as discussed earlier in Remark 3.1.8, we may instead work with tensor functors from $\mathcal{C}$ to $\mathcal{C}_{(E)}$. Indeed, the dual ${{\tau}^{\vee}}$ is used, for convenience, in the proof of Theorem 3.2.9 below, but everything can be translated back and forth, by dualising. As in the concrete setup of the previous section, objects of the form $\tau(\mathit{X})$ can be interpreted as “functions” on ${{\mathit{X}}^{\vee}}$. See §3.3 for more details. ∎ 3.2.6. Corollary 3.1.12 and Proposition 3.1.13 show how, given an action of $\mathfrak{M}_{0}$ on $\mathbold{Z}$ and an $\mathfrak{M}_{0}$-group $\mathbold{G}$, $\mathpzc{Rep}_{\mathbold}{G}$ acquires an $E_{0}$-structure. We note that in this case, ${{\tau}^{\vee}}(\mathit{X})=E\otimes_{\mu}\mathit{X}$ (by Lemma 3.1.7). Conversely, as mentioned above, given an $E_{0}$-tensor category $\mathcal{C}$ over $\Bbbk$, the functor $\tau$ determines a map $\tau_{\mathbold}{1}:\Bbbk=\operatorname{End}(\mathbold{1})\xrightarrow{}{}% \operatorname{End}({{E}^{\vee}})=E$. The two isomorphisms given with the $E_{0}$-structure on $\mathcal{C}$ show that this map corresponds to an action $\mu:\operatorname{spec}(E)=\mathfrak{M}_{0}\times\mathbold{Z}\xrightarrow{}% \mathbold{Z}$. Proposition 3.2.7. The process described in 3.2.6 determines a bijection between actions of $\mathfrak{M}_{0}$ on $\mathbold{Z}=\operatorname{spec}(\Bbbk)$ and isomorphism classes of $E_{0}$-structures on $\mathpzc{Vec}_{\Bbbk}$ (all over $\Bbbk_{0}$) Proof. This is a direct computation. Starting with an action $\mu:\mathfrak{M}\xrightarrow{}\mathbold{Z}$, corresponding to a pro-algebra map $f:\Bbbk\xrightarrow{}{}E$, we have $\mu^{*}(\mathbold{1})={{E}^{\vee}}$, and given an endomorphism $a\in\Bbbk$ of $\mathbold{1}$, $\mu^{*}(a)$ is given by the “right” vector space structure on ${{E}^{\vee}}$, via $\mu$. Hence $\tau_{\mathbold}{1}=f$. Conversely, since the functor $\tau$ is exact, it is determined by its value on $\mathbold{1}$ (and $\operatorname{End}(\mathbold{1})$), so by the map $f=\tau_{1}:\Bbbk\xrightarrow{}{}E$. ∎ Definition 3.2.8. Let $\mathcal{C}$ be an $E_{0}$-tensor category. An $E_{0}$-fibre functor on $\mathcal{C}$ is an $E_{0}$-tensor functor from $\mathcal{C}$ to $\mathpzc{Vec}_{\Bbbk}$, where the latter has the $E_{0}$-structure corresponding to the action recovered from $\mathcal{C}$. An $E_{0}$-Tannakian category is an $E_{0}$-tensor category that admits an $E_{0}$-fibre functor. More generally, if $K$ is an $\mathfrak{M}$-field extension of $\Bbbk$, an $E_{0}$-fibre functor over $K$ is an $E_{0}$-tensor functor from $\mathcal{C}$ to $\mathpzc{Vec}_{K}$, with the corresponding $E_{0}$-structure. We may now formulate and prove the main Theorem: $E_{0}$-Tannakian categories are precisely categories of representations of (pro-) linear $\mathfrak{M}_{0}$-groups. Theorem 3.2.9. Let $\omega$ be an $E_{0}$-fibre functor on an $E_{0}$-tensor category $\mathcal{C}$. Then there is a pro-linear $E_{0}$-group scheme $\mathbold{G}$ over $\Bbbk$, and an action of $\mathbold{G}$ on each $\omega$, making $\omega$ an $E_{0}$-tensor equivalence between $\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathpzc{Rep}_{\mathbold}{G}$. If $\mathcal{C}=\mathpzc{Rep}_{\mathbold}{H}$ for some pro-linear $E_{0}$-group scheme, then $\mathbold{H}$ is canonically isomorphic to $\mathbold{G}$. Proof. Let $\mathbold{G}$ be the usual pro-linear group scheme $\underline{Aut}^{\otimes}(\omega)$ over $\Bbbk$ associated to the fibre functor $\omega$. As indicated by Proposition 3.1.3, this should be the underlying pro-linear group scheme, so our task is to give $\mathbold{G}$ the structure of a $\mathfrak{M}_{0}$-scheme, over the $\mathfrak{M}_{0}$-structure on $\mathbold{Z}=\operatorname{spec}(\Bbbk)$. Thus, we should define an action map $\mu:\mathfrak{M}_{0}\times\mathbold{G}\xrightarrow{}\mathbold{G}$ over $\Bbbk$, where the domain is given the $\Bbbk$-structure coming from the action map $\mu_{0}:\mathfrak{M}_{0}\times\mathbold{Z}\xrightarrow{}\mathbold{Z}$. In other words, we should provide a compatible system $\mu_{A}$ of monoid actions $\mu_{A}:\mathfrak{M}_{0}(A)\times\mathbold{G}(A)\xrightarrow{}\mathbold{G}(A)$, one for each $\Bbbk_{0}$-algebra $A$. Here, $\mathbold{G}(A)$ is the set of maps $\operatorname{spec}(A)\xrightarrow{}\mathbold{G}$ over $\Bbbk_{0}$, and similarly for $\mathfrak{M}_{0}$. Furthermore, these maps should respect the $\Bbbk$-structure in the following sense: Given an element $y\in\mathfrak{M}_{0}(A)$, and an element $g\in\mathbold{G}(A)$ mapping to an element $p\in\mathbold{Z}(A)$, $\mu_{A}(y,g)$ is a map of schemes $h:\operatorname{spec}(A)\xrightarrow{}\mathbold{G}$ such that the diagram $\xymatrix{\operatorname{spec}(A)\ar[r]^{h}\ar[d]_{(y,p)}&\mathbold{G}\ar[d]\\ \mathfrak{M}_{0}\times\mathbold{Z}\ar[r]_{\mu_{0}}&\mathbold{Z}}$ commutes. We denote by $A^{(y)}$ the ring $A$ with the $\Bbbk$-algebra structure coming from diagram (32) (in the language of 2.2.6, $\operatorname{spec}(A^{(y)})=\mu_{!}(\operatorname{spec}(A))$ as schemes over $\mathbold{Z}$). We thus fix a $\Bbbk$-algebra $A$. By the definition of $\mathbold{G}$, we should produce, for each $A$-point $y$ of $\mathfrak{M}_{0}$, and each tensor automorphism $g$ of $A\otimes_{\Bbbk}\omega$ over $A$, an automorphism $\mu(y,g)$ of $A^{(y)}\otimes_{\Bbbk}\omega$, again over $A$. An $A$-point of $\mathfrak{M}_{0}$ factors, by definition, through a finite sub-scheme $\mathfrak{M}_{0}^{\prime}$. Also by definition, the structure $\tau$ restricts to a tensor functor $\mathcal{C}^{(E^{\prime})}$, where $\mathfrak{M}_{0}^{\prime}=\operatorname{spec}(E_{0}^{\prime})$, and $E^{\prime}=E_{0}\otimes\Bbbk$. So as long as the $A$-point $y$ is fixed, we may assume that $E=E_{0}\otimes\Bbbk$ is finite (the same is true for any finite number of points). We are thus given a map of $\Bbbk_{0}$-algebras $y:E_{0}\xrightarrow{}{}A$ (in fact, we may at this point assume $A=E$ and $y$ the identity, but this will be inconvenient when comparing several points). Consider now an object $\mathit{X}$. The $E$-structure on the fibre functor $\omega$ determines an $E$-module isomorphism $u_{\mathit{X}}:\omega({{\tau}^{\vee}}(\mathit{X}))\xrightarrow{}{}E\otimes_{% \mu}\omega(\mathit{X})$ (the right hand side is what we denoted $E^{(z)}\otimes_{\Bbbk}\omega(\mathit{X})$, where $z:E\xrightarrow{}{}E$ is the identity). Using $y$ we thus obtain an $A$-module isomorphism $A\otimes_{E}u_{\mathit{X}}:A\otimes_{E}\omega({{\tau}^{\vee}}(\mathit{X}))% \xrightarrow{}A^{(y)}\otimes\omega(\mathit{X})$ If $g\in\mathbold{G}(A)$ is an automorphism of $A\otimes_{\Bbbk}\omega$, we note that $g_{{{\tau}^{\vee}}(\mathit{X})}:A\otimes_{\Bbbk}\omega({{\tau}^{\vee}}(\mathit% {X}))\xrightarrow{}{}A\otimes_{\Bbbk}\omega({{\tau}^{\vee}}(\mathit{X}))$ is an $E$-module automorphism (since $E$ acts on objects in $\mathcal{C}$), so it descends to an automorphism of $A\otimes_{E}\omega({{\tau}^{\vee}}(\mathit{X}))$. Hence we obtain an induced map $\xymatrix{A\otimes_{E}\omega({{\tau}^{\vee}}(\mathit{X}))\ar[r]^{A\otimes_{E}u% _{\mathit{X}}}\ar[d]_{g_{{{\tau}^{\vee}}(\mathit{X})}}&A^{(y)}\otimes_{\Bbbk}% \omega(\mathit{X})\ar[d]^{\mu(y,g)_{\mathit{X}}}\\ A\otimes_{E}\omega({{\tau}^{\vee}}(\mathit{X}))\ar[r]^{A\otimes_{E}u_{\mathit{% X}}}&A^{(y)}\otimes_{\Bbbk}\omega(\mathit{X})}$ with $\mu(y,g)$ the map as indicated. This concludes the definition of $\mu$. To verify that the map is a monoid action, if, in the above definition, $y:E_{0}\xrightarrow{}\Bbbk$ corresponds to the identity of $\mathfrak{M}_{0}$, then $A^{(y)}\otimes_{\Bbbk}\omega(\mathit{X})=\omega(\mathit{X})$, and the induced map in (34) is just $g_{\mathit{X}}$ (using the existence of the isomorphism $a$ from (22) of Definition 3.2.4). Next, assume that we are given two points $y_{1},y_{2}:E_{0}\xrightarrow{}{}A$, and let $y=(y_{1},y_{2})\circ{}m^{\#}$ be their product in $\mathfrak{M}_{0}$. We first note that from the fact that we have an action on $\mathbold{Z}$ we get an isomorphism (over $\Bbbk$) ${(A^{(y_{2})})}^{(y_{1})}\xrightarrow{}{}A^{(y)}$. Now, applying the definition (34) twice, we get a diagram $\xymatrix{A^{(y_{2})}\otimes_{y_{1}}\omega({{\tau}^{\vee}}{{\tau}^{\vee}}(% \mathit{X}))\ar[r]\ar[d]_{g_{{{\tau}^{\vee}}{{\tau}^{\vee}}(\mathit{X})}}&{A^{% (y_{2})}}^{(y_{1})}\otimes_{\Bbbk}\omega(\mathit{X})\ar[d]^{\mu(y_{1},\mu(y_{2% },g))_{\mathit{X}}}\\ A^{(y_{2})}\otimes_{y_{1}}\omega({{\tau}^{\vee}}{{\tau}^{\vee}}(\mathit{X}))% \ar[r]&{A^{(y_{2})}}^{(y_{1})}\otimes_{\Bbbk}\omega(\mathit{X})}$ Applying the isomorphism $b$ from Definition 3.2.4, we may replace $\omega({{\tau}^{\vee}}{{\tau}^{\vee}}(\mathit{X}))$ with $E\otimes_{\Bbbk}{}E\otimes_{m}\omega({{\tau}^{\vee}}(\mathit{X}))$, so the left part of the diagram becomes $A\otimes_{E}\omega({{\tau}^{\vee}}(\mathit{X}))$, with the $E$-structure on $A$ given by $y$. This concludes the proof that $\mu$ is an action. The fact that $\omega$ induces an equivalence of $\mathcal{C}$ with $\mathpzc{Rep}_{\mathbold}{G}$ follows from the adjunction, as in Proposition 3.1.3. For the last part, assume that $\mathcal{C}$ is the $E_{0}$-tensor category associated with a pro-linear $\mathfrak{M}$-group scheme. By the usual Tannakian formalism and the construction, the underlying group scheme is $\mathbold{G}$. Thus, we need only verify that the action of $\mathfrak{M}$ is the same. This is clear, since the functor $\tau$ was defined in the same way for representations of $\mathbold{G}$ and for vector spaces. ∎ Remark 3.2.10. Analogously to the algebraic case, if $\mathbold{T}=\operatorname{spec}(B)$ is an $\mathfrak{M}$-scheme over $\mathbold{Z}$, and $g_{0}:\mathbold{T}\xrightarrow{}\mathbold{G}$ is a $\mathbold{T}$-point of $\mathbold{G}$ (so it commutes with the action), then $g$ determines an automorphism of $B\otimes_{\Bbbk}\omega$ as an $E_{0}$-functor. Indeed, such a point determines an automorphism $g_{0}$ of $B\otimes_{\Bbbk}\omega$ as a tensor functor. Let $A=B\otimes_{\Bbbk}{}E$, let $y:E\xrightarrow{}{}A$ be the obvious map, and let $g$ be the induced automorphism of $A\otimes\omega$. Then, by diagram (34) we have a diagram $\xymatrix{B\otimes_{\Bbbk}\omega({{\tau}^{\vee}}(\mathit{X}))\ar[r]^{A\otimes_% {E}u_{\mathit{X}}}\ar[d]_{g_{{{\tau}^{\vee}}(\mathit{X})}}&A^{(y)}\otimes_{% \Bbbk}\omega(\mathit{X})\ar[d]^{\mu(y,g)_{\mathit{X}}}\\ B\otimes_{\Bbbk}\omega({{\tau}^{\vee}}(\mathit{X}))\ar[r]^{A\otimes_{E}u_{% \mathit{X}}}&A^{(y)}\otimes_{\Bbbk}\omega(\mathit{X})}$ Now, since the action of $y$ on $\mathbold{G}$ commutes with that on $\mathbold{T}$, the map on the right is $(B\otimes{}E_{0})\otimes_{B}{g_{0}}_{\mathit{X}}$ (tensor product with respect to the action $B\xrightarrow{}{}B\otimes{}E_{0}$). Composing with the isomorphism $B\otimes{}E_{0}\otimes_{B}{}B\otimes_{\Bbbk}\omega(\mathit{X})\xrightarrow{}{}% B\otimes_{\Bbbk}{}E\otimes_{\mu}\omega(\mathit{X})$ (coming from the fact that that action on $\mathbold{T}$ is over $\mathbold{Z}$), we get the compatibility required in Definition 3.2.4. ∎ $\mathfrak{M}$-schemes in $\mathcal{C}$ As with usual tensor categories, it is possible to define the category of (affine) $\mathfrak{M}$-schemes. This is the opposite category to the category of $\mathfrak{M}$-algebras in $\mathcal{C}$, defined as follows. Recall, first, that an algebra in $\mathcal{C}$ is an ind-object $\mathit{X}$ of $\mathcal{C}$, together with (suitable) maps $m:\mathit{X}\otimes\mathit{X}\xrightarrow{}\mathit{X}$ and $u:\mathbold{1}\xrightarrow{}\mathit{X}$. If $\mathcal{C}$ is given with an $E_{0}$-structure $(\tau,a,b)$, the tensor structure on $\tau$ makes $\tau(\mathit{X})$ an algebra as well. We note that the isomorphism $a$ induces a map $a_{\mathit{X}}:\mathit{X}\xrightarrow{}\tau\mathit{X}$, which is an algebra map (since $a$ is a tensor isomorphism). We recall that in the case of usual algebras, $\tau(\mathit{X})$ was the analogue of the algebra of functions on the arc space of the scheme associated to $\mathit{X}$. Hence the following definition is natural. Definition 3.3.1. Let $(\mathcal{C},\tau,a,b)$ be an $E$-tensor category, $\mathit{X}$ an algebra in $\mathcal{C}$. An $E$-structure on $\mathit{X}$ consists of an algebra map $d:\tau(\mathit{X})\xrightarrow{}\mathit{X}$, such that $d\circ{}a_{\mathit{X}}$ is the identity, and the following diagram commutes $\xymatrix{\tau\tau\mathit{X}\ar[rr]^{\tau(d)}\ar[d]_{b_{\mathit{X}}}&&\tau% \mathit{X}\ar[d]^{d}\\ m^{!}\tau\mathit{X}\ar[r]_{m}&\tau\mathit{X}\ar[r]_{d}&\mathit{X}}$ The category of (affine) $\mathfrak{M}_{0}$-schemes in $\mathcal{C}$ is the opposite of the category of algebras with $E$-structure (and maps of between them that preserve this structure) As in previously known cases, any object $\mathit{X}$ has an associated “affine space” $\mathcal{C}$-scheme $A(\mathit{X})$. These affine spaces were important in the differential case to achieve elimination of imaginaries in the corresponding theory (cf \citet[4.4–4.5]tannakian), and played an important role in \citetMR1106898. The construction of $A(\mathit{X})$ is a special case of the following result, which says that prolongation spaces also exist in $\mathcal{C}$. The defining property is taken to be analogous to the adjunction in 2.2.7 (the affine case should also be compared to Proposition 2.3.11). Proposition 3.3.2. Let $\mathcal{C}$ by an $E$-tensor category. The forgetful functor from $\mathfrak{M}$-schemes to schemes in $\mathcal{C}$ has a right adjoint. Proof. Given a (usual) scheme with algebra $\mathit{W}$ in $\mathcal{C}$, the induced $\mathfrak{M}$-scheme corresponds to $\tau\mathit{W}$, with $d:\tau\tau\mathit{W}\xrightarrow{}\tau\mathit{W}$ induced by the product on $\mathfrak{M}$. The fact that this is an $\mathfrak{M}$-scheme structure comes from the monoid axioms on $\mathfrak{M}$. Given some other $\mathfrak{M}$-scheme $\mathit{X}$, $d:\tau\mathit{X}\xrightarrow{}\mathit{X}$, an algebra map $f:\mathit{W}\xrightarrow{}\mathit{X}$ determines a algebra maps $\tau(f):\tau\mathit{W}\xrightarrow{}\tau\mathit{X}$ and $\tau^{2}(f):\tau^{2}\mathit{W}\xrightarrow{}\tau^{2}\mathit{X}$, resulting, upon composition with $d$ and $\tau(d)$, in maps $\tilde{f}:\tau\mathit{W}\xrightarrow{}\mathit{X}$ and $\tilde{f}_{\tau}:\tau\tau\mathit{W}\xrightarrow{}\tau\mathit{X}$. The fact that these maps determine a map of $\mathfrak{M}$-schemes comes from diagram (37). In the other direction, a map $\tau\mathit{W}\xrightarrow{}\mathit{X}$ restricts to a map $\mathit{W}\xrightarrow{}\mathit{X}$. It is standard to check that these are inverse to each other. ∎ Remark 3.3.3. If $\mathfrak{M}$ is the free formal monoid generated by some formal set $\mathfrak{M}_{1}$, the data in Definition 3.3.1 can be given in terms of $\mathfrak{M}_{1}$, as a map $d_{1}:\tau_{1}(\mathit{X})\xrightarrow{}\mathit{X}$, without the condition (37). The full $d:\tau\mathit{X}\xrightarrow{}\mathit{X}$ can then be reconstructed as the unique map extending $d_{1}$ and satisfying (37). In the case where $\mathfrak{M}_{1}=\operatorname{spec}(\Bbbk_{0}[\epsilon])$ (where $\Bbbk_{0}$ is a field of characteristic $0$ and $\epsilon^{2}=0$), the corresponding $\mathfrak{M}$ is the additive formal group (Example 2.3.4), and the explicit construction of $\tau\mathit{X}$ and of $d$ was (essentially) carried out in \citet[4.4.3]tannakian ($\tau\mathit{X}$ is the ind-object with maps $q_{n}$ there; the map $d$ is essentially given by the $t_{n}$). ∎ Passing to a sub-field In this section we prove an analogue of \citet[Corollary 6.20]MR1106898. The corollary says that if a Tannakian category $\mathcal{C}$ over a field $\Bbbk$ admits a fibre functor over some $\Bbbk$-algebra, then it admits a fibre functor over a finite extension of $\Bbbk$. Put another way, a Tannakian category over a field $\Bbbk$ admits a fibre functor over the algebraic closure of $\Bbbk$. This result is useful, for example, in applications to Galois theory, as presented in the Introduction (§0.1). We maintain the notation and assumptions of §3.1. For convenience, we assume that $\mathfrak{M}$ is a (formal) group. Definition 3.4.1. Let $\kappa$ be a cardinal. We say that the formal group $\mathfrak{M}$ is $<\!\!\kappa$-generated if there is a formal set $\mathfrak{N}$, such that $\mathfrak{M}$ is a quotient of the free formal group generated by $\mathfrak{N}$, and $\mathfrak{N}$ can be presented by a filtering system of size smaller than $\kappa$. We say that $\mathfrak{M}$ is $<\!\!\kappa$-presented if it is $<\!\!\kappa$-generated, and the kernel of the quotient map is also $<\!\!\kappa$-generated. We say finitely or countably generated (or presented) if $\kappa$ is $\omega$ or $\omega_{1}$, respectively. For example, a (discrete) group is finitely generated or presented if it is such in the usual sense. We note that when $\kappa>\omega$, we may replace this by the condition that $\mathfrak{M}$ itself is given by a system of cardinality less than $\kappa$. Example 3.4.2. If $\Bbbk$ has characteristic $0$, then $\operatorname{spec}(\Bbbk[[x]])$ is finitely generated (and presented) by $\operatorname{spec}(\Bbbk[\epsilon])$ (according to Example 2.3.4). In characteristic $p>0$, it is countably presented, since the quotients to finitely many of the variables $e_{i}$ (of the algebra $TE$ in the same example) are all finite. ∎ From now on, we fix $\kappa$, and assume that $\mathfrak{M}$ is $<\!\!\kappa$-presented. Definition 3.4.3. We say that an $\mathfrak{M}$-field $\Bbbk$ is $\mathfrak{M}$-closed if any non-empty $\mathfrak{M}$-pro-variety over $\Bbbk$ that can be given by a $<\!\!\kappa$-system of varieties, has a $\Bbbk$-point (i.e., an $\mathfrak{M}$-morphism from $\operatorname{spec}(\Bbbk)$). Model theoretically, an $\mathfrak{M}$-closed field is a weak version of a universal domain. We note that, unlike in algebraic geometry, a non empty $\mathfrak{M}$-variety need not have a point in an $\mathfrak{M}$-field. For instance, the system of equations $x^{2}=1,\sigma(x)=-x$ (where $\sigma$ is an automorphism), has no solution in a field. In this case, $\mathfrak{M}$-closed fields do not exist, and the statement of Proposition 3.4.4 below is empty. The proof does show, however, that there is a fibre functor over an $\mathfrak{M}$-algebra over $\Bbbk$, which is finite generated and “simple” as an $\mathfrak{M}$-algebra. We note that when $\mathfrak{M}$ is local, the action of it on a variety restricts to an action on each irreducible component, and therefore to its generic point, a field. Hence, in this case, $\mathfrak{M}$-closed fields exist by the standard arguments. We say that an $\mathfrak{M}$-tensor category is generated by a collection $S$ of objects if $S_{\tau}=\{\tau_{E}(\mathit{X})|\mathit{X}\in{}S\}$ generates it as a tensor category. We note that, since $\tau$ is an exact tensor functor, the tensor category generated by $S_{\tau}$ is automatically an $\mathfrak{M}$-tensor category. The following proposition is an analogue of \citet[6.20]MR1106898 for our setting. As before, we only need to reduce to it, rather than re-prove it, using the current framework. Proposition 3.4.4. Let $(\mathcal{C},\tau,a,b)$ be an $\mathfrak{M}$-tensor category over an $\mathfrak{M}$-closed field $\Bbbk$. Assume that $\mathcal{C}$ is generated as an $\mathfrak{M}$-tensor category by one object, and that it admits a fibre functor over some $\mathfrak{M}$-field extension of $\Bbbk$. Then it admit a fibre functor over $\Bbbk$. Proof. Let $\mathfrak{M}=\operatorname{spec}(E)$ be finite. We first note that in the case of vector bundles, the operation ${{\tau}^{\vee}}$ can be described geometrically as follows. Let $\mathbold{X}$ be a scheme over $\mathbold{Z}=\operatorname{spec}(\Bbbk)$. By definition of $\mu^{*}$, we have a map $\mu^{*}(\mathbold{X})\xrightarrow{}\mathbold{X}$, and adjunction provides a map $p^{*}p_{*}\mu^{*}(\mathbold{X})\xrightarrow{}\mu^{*}(\mathbold{X})$. Let $r$ be the composed map. Again by the definition of $p^{*}$ we also have a map $s:p^{*}p_{*}\mu^{*}(\mathbold{X})\xrightarrow{}{}p_{*}(\mu^{*}(\mathbold{X}))=% \tau(\mathbold{X})$. Now, if $V$ is a vector bundle on $\mathbold{X}$, we obtain a vector bundle $s_{*}r^{*}(V)$ on $\tau(\mathbold{X})$ (this is a vector bundle since $s$ is finite and flat). In the case when $\mathbold{X}=\mathbold{Z}$, this is ${{\tau}^{\vee}}$. Now, assume that $\mathcal{C}$ is generated (as an $\mathfrak{M}$-tensor category) by an object $\mathit{X}$, and has a fibre functor over some $\mathfrak{M}$-scheme over $\Bbbk$. Let $\mathcal{C}_{0}$ be the tensor category generated by $\mathit{X}$. According to the proof of \citet[6.20]MR1106898, there is an affine variety $\mathbold{S}_{0}$ over $\Bbbk$, a fibre functor $\omega_{0}$ of $\mathcal{C}_{0}$ over $\mathbold{S}_{0}$, and a faithfully flat groupoid scheme $\mathbold{G}_{0}$ over $\mathbold{S}_{0}$ such that $\mathcal{C}_{0}$ is identified by $\omega_{0}$ with the category of representations of $\mathbold{G}_{0}$. Similarly, the tensor category $\mathcal{C}_{E}$ generated by $\mathit{X}$ and ${{\tau}^{\vee}}(\mathit{X})$ is equivalent the category of representations of a faithfully flat groupoid scheme $\mathbold{G}_{E}$ over a variety $\mathbold{S}_{E}$. By the first paragraph, the $\mathfrak{M}$-structure on $\omega$ produces (perhaps after a flat, finite type localisation) a map $\mathbold{S}_{E}\xrightarrow{}\tau\mathbold{S}_{0}$. Now, dropping the assumption that $\mathfrak{M}$ is finite, we iterate the construction for a system of size $<\!\!\kappa$. We obtain a projective system $\mathbold{S}=(\mathbold{S}_{E})$ of varieties, and a fibre functor $\bar{\omega}$ over $\mathbold{S}$. The system $\mathbold{S}$ inherits an $\mathfrak{M}$-structure from the prolongations, and by construction, $\bar{\omega}$ is an $\mathfrak{M}$-tensor functor. By the assumption on $\Bbbk$, $\mathbold{S}$ has a $\Bbbk$-point $s$. The fibre $\bar{w}_{s}$ is an $\mathfrak{M}$-fibre functor over $\Bbbk$. ∎ Questions and Speculations In this section I point out some questions and other issues I would like to clarify. At least some of them should be easy to answer, but I do not see the answer immediately, and they are not directly relevant to the main point of the paper, so I leave them unanswered. Nevertheless, I think they are interesting. Sheaves on formal sets As explained in §1.3, if $\mathfrak{M}$ is a formal set (viewed as a filtering system), and $\mathcal{C}\xrightarrow{}\mathfrak{M}$ is a fibred category over $\mathfrak{M}$, whose fibres are (say) sheaves of some kind over the corresponding finite piece, then $\underset{\mathfrak{M}}{\varprojlim}\,\mathcal{C}$ can be viewed as the category of sheaves of the same kind on $\mathfrak{M}$. However, it does not seem to be straightforward to deduce properties of $\underset{\mathfrak{M}}{\varprojlim}\,\mathcal{C}$ from properties of the fibres. For instance, assume that each fibre is abelian. May we conclude that the limit is abelian? The answer is “no” in general, and “yes” if each pullback functor is exact. However, in our situation this assumption does not hold. In the context of 1.3.6, we know that the pullbacks are either left or right-exact (and, indeed, admit a left or right adjoint), but not both. Can anything be said in this case? In special cases such as completions of Noetherian local rings and finitely generated modules, one ends up with an abelian category, but this does depend on the Artin–Rees Lemma or similar results. More generally, this appears like it should be a classical construction, but I don’t know what would be a good reference. Cartier duality The usual Tannakian formalism can be viewed as a generalisation of Cartier duality to more general groups: Given a rigid tensor category $\mathcal{C}$, the tensor product determines a group structure on the set of isomorphism classes of invertible objects (in other words, this is the group of invertible elements in the Grothendieck ring of $\mathcal{C}$). We may call this group the Picard group of $\mathcal{C}$. When $\mathcal{C}$ is the category of representations of an algebraic group $\mathbold{G}$ of multiplicative type (say, $\mathbold{G}_{m}$), it is determined by the invertible objects, and the Picard group of $\mathcal{C}$ is the Cartier dual of $\mathbold{G}$. For general $\mathbold{G}$, it is thus reasonable to view $\mathcal{C}=\mathpzc{Rep}_{\mathbold}{G}$ as an analogue of the Cartier dual (and the recovery of $\mathbold{G}$ from $\mathcal{C}$ an analogue of recovering $\mathbold{G}$ from its dual). When $\mathbold{G}=\mathbold{G}_{a}$, there are no non-trivial invertible representations, so the usual Cartier dual carries no information, but in Example 2.3.7 it is shown that (in characteristic $0$), the additive formal group should be viewed as the Cartier dual of $\mathbold{G}_{a}$, which suggests that this formal group is in some sense the Picard group for the category of representations of $\mathbold{G}_{a}$. The question is how to recover this formal group directly from the category $\mathcal{C}=\mathpzc{Rep}_{\mathbold{G}_{a}}$, and more generally, whether one can compute a meaningful (formal) Picard group like that for an arbitrary tensor category. Another question related to the duality: In characteristic $0$, the group schemes $\mathbold{G}_{m}$ and $\mathbold{G}_{a}$ correspond, respectively, to the cases of an automorphisms and a derivation, and they are the only affine groups of dimension $1$. So it seems that we have shown that the only “rank $1$” operators in characteristic $0$ are automorphisms and derivations. The question is how to explain what “rank $1$” means, without going through Cartier duality (this might be related to the classification mentioned in \citet[2.4]MR2166202). Quotients In the usual treatment of differential and difference fields, an important role is played by the “field of constants”. It played no role in this paper, but it is still interesting to define it in the general context of §2. We have a categorical description. Given a scheme $\mathit{X}$ (over $\Bbbk_{0}$), one may view $\mathit{X}$ as an $\mathfrak{M}$-scheme $\underline{\mathit{X}}$ via the trivial action. We may then define quotient by $\mathfrak{M}$ to be the “left-adjoint” to this functor: Given an $\mathfrak{M}$-scheme $\mathit{Z}$, $\mathit{Z}/\mathfrak{M}$ is defined as a covariant functor on schemes $\mathit{X}$ by $(\mathit{Z}/\mathfrak{M})(\mathit{X})=\operatorname{Hom}_{\mathfrak{M}}(% \mathit{Z},\underline{\mathit{X}})$. The problem is that there is no reason that this functor should be representable (unless, of course, $\mathfrak{M}$ is finite), and furthermore, it seems impossible to describe maps from a scheme to $\mathit{Z}/\mathfrak{M}$. In the affine case, we do have an algebra associated to $\mathit{Z}/\mathfrak{M}$: if $\mathit{Z}=\operatorname{spec}(\Bbbk)$, with action of $\mathfrak{M}$ given by $m$ and projection given by $p$ (both on the level of algebras), then $\mathit{Z}/\mathfrak{M}$ corresponds to the sub-algebra given by $p(a)=m(a)$. If $\Bbbk$ is a field, then this sub-algebra is a field as well, and this definition coincides with the usual one in the difference and differential case. Relation to crystals We note that the definition of an $E$-structure on an object $\mathit{X}$, given in 3.3.1 for algebra objects $\mathit{X}$, makes sense also for objects $\mathit{X}$ of $\mathcal{C}$ itself (of course, $d$ is no longer an algebra map). Let $\mathbold{Y}$ be a variety over a field $\Bbbk_{0}$ of characteristic $0$. Recall (\citetlurie or \citet[§ 1.5]MR0491705) that a crystal of quasi-coherent sheaves on $\mathbold{Y}$ consists of a quasi-coherent sheaf $\mathcal{F}$ on $\mathbold{Y}$, together with isomorphisms $\eta_{x,y}:\mathcal{F}_{x}\xrightarrow{}\mathcal{F}_{y}$ for any infinitesimally close $R$-points $x$ and $y$ of $\mathbold{Y}$ (i.e., $x$ and $y$ have the same restriction to $\operatorname{spec}(R)_{red}$; $R$ is any $\Bbbk_{0}$-algebra). These isomorphisms should satisfy some natural properties (so that $\mathcal{F}$ is a “locally trivial” sheaf on the infinitesimal site of $\mathbold{Y}$). We note that when the projection from $R$ to $R/I$ ($I$ the nilradical of $R$) has a section, it is enough to specify these isomorphisms when $x$ is the restriction of $y$ to $\operatorname{spec}(R/I)$. Let $\mathcal{F}$ be such a crystal, and let $\Bbbk$ be the field of rational functions on $\mathbold{Y}$. A derivation of $\Bbbk$ over $\Bbbk_{0}$ (i.e., a meromorphic vector-field on $\mathbold{Y}$) determines, for each $n$, an $E_{n}$-point $y$ of $\mathbold{Y}$, where $E_{n}=\Bbbk[x]/x^{n+1}$, and the crystal data provides an isomorphism $\mathcal{F}_{x}\xrightarrow{}\mathcal{F}_{y}$, where $x$ is the point corresponding to the $0$ vector-field. This is the same as an $E_{n}$-isomorphism $E_{n}\otimes_{y}{}M\xrightarrow{}{}E_{n}\otimes{}M$, where $M$ is the fibre of $\mathcal{F}$ on the generic point. Composing $y$ with the co-multiplication $m$ of $E$ we likewise get isomorphisms involving $E\otimes{}E$, and the compatibility conditions on the crystal imply that the diagram (37) commutes. Hence, a crystal structure on a quasi-coherent sheaf determines, for each vector-field, an $E=\Bbbk_{0}[[x]]$-structure on it. A similar analysis applies crystals in other categories (e.g., a crystal of schemes, as in \citetlurie), and also for the Crystalline site in positive characteristic (cf. \citet[Prop. 5.1]MR0491705; note that the Crystalline site corresponds to usual, rather than Hasse–Schmidt derivations, as in Example 2.3.4). It would be interesting to understand the precise relation, and whether it is useful. Changing the monoid Throughout, we work with a fixed formal monoid $\mathfrak{M}$. It makes sense, of course, to ask what happens when we let $\mathfrak{M}$ vary. For example, in the context of several derivations, it could be desirable to pass to a subset of the derivations, or to a more convenient choice of them. In particular, in the context of the Tannakian formalism, $\mathfrak{M}$ is recovered from $\mathcal{C}^{(E)}$ (as $\operatorname{End}(\mathbold{1}_{E})$), so one could ask to replace $\mathcal{C}^{(E)}$ by an abstract category of prolongations $\mathcal{D}$. This would entail finding conditions under which $\mathcal{D}$ is canonically isomorphic to $\mathcal{C}^{(E)}$ for $E=\operatorname{End}(\mathbold{1}_{\mathcal{D}})$ (over a given tensor functor $\mathcal{C}\xrightarrow{}\mathcal{D}$). Such a formalism would treat all formal monoid actions at once. I leave it to some other time. More general monads Instead of working with with a formal monoid $\mathfrak{M}$, as we did, we could work more generally with the corresponding monad $\mathscr{W}_{\mathfrak{M}}$, given by $\mathscr{W}_{\mathfrak{M}}(\mathbold{Z})=\mathfrak{M}\times\mathbold{Z}$. The advantage is that we may then forget about $\mathfrak{M}$ and work just with a monad $\mathscr{W}$ on the category of ind-schemes (over a given base $\Bbbk_{0}$; we would probably be assuming that $\mathscr{W}$ is “continuous”, i.e., determined by its restriction to schemes). Given such a monad, an $\mathfrak{M}$-scheme is replaced by a $\mathscr{W}$-algebra $\mathbold{Z}$, and likewise $\mathfrak{M}$-schemes over $\mathbold{Z}$ are replaced by $\mathscr{W}$-algebras over $\mathbold{Z}$. The main difference with our approach is that we are no longer assuming to have a functorial map $p:\mathscr{W}(\mathit{X})\xrightarrow{}\mathit{X}$ (the projection). There are at least two interesting examples covered only by this more general approach: The $p$-adic Witt scheme of length $2$, $\mathscr{W}=\mathscr{W}_{2}$, corresponding to the arithmetic differential equations of \citetMR2166202 (See especially \citet[§ 2.4]MR2166202), and its global analogue, the big Witt vector functor, corresponding to the theory $\Lambda$-spaces of \citetborger (which are offered there as a notion of spaces over $\mathbb{F}_{1}$). If $\mathscr{W}$ happens to have a right adjoint $\tau_{0}$ (possibly going from schemes to pro-schemes), which is then automatically a co-monad, then an algebra $\mathbold{Z}$ for $\mathscr{W}$ determines a co-algebra $t:\mathbold{Z}\xrightarrow{}\tau_{0}\mathbold{Z}$ for $\tau_{0}$. Given a scheme $\mathbold{X}$ over $\mathbold{Z}$, we set $\tau(\mathbold{X})=\tau_{0}(\mathbold{X})\times_{t}\mathbold{Z}$, and call it the prolongation of $\mathbold{X}$ (viewed as a pro-scheme over $\mathbold{Z}$). As in 2.2.7, $\tau$ is a co-monad on pro-schemes over $\mathbold{Z}$, and is, by construction, right adjoint to the forgetful functor from $\mathscr{W}$-schemes to schemes. The main issue with extending the results of the paper is now to find the analogue of tensoring with $E$ to this setting, i.e., we need a canonical way to extend $\mathscr{W}$ (or $\tau$) to a tensor category over $\mathbold{Z}$. This should be possible. \printbibliography
Definition 1.3.9. For a pro-finite algebra $E$, we defined $\mathcal{C}_{(E)}$, the category of flat $E$-modules in $\mathcal{C}$, to be the limit $\underset{\mathcal{I}}{\varprojlim}\,\mathcal{C}^{f}$ of the fibred category of flat modules along $\mathcal{I}$. Dually, we define the category of $E$-injective modules (or the $E$-prolongation of $\mathcal{C}$) $\mathcal{C}^{(E)}$ as the limit $\underset{\mathcal{I}}{\varprojlim}\,\mathcal{C}^{i}$.
Definition 3.4.1. Let $\kappa$ be a cardinal. We say that the formal group $\mathfrak{M}$ is $<\!\!\kappa$-generated if there is a formal set $\mathfrak{N}$, such that $\mathfrak{M}$ is a quotient of the free formal group generated by $\mathfrak{N}$, and $\mathfrak{N}$ can be presented by a filtering system of size smaller than $\kappa$. We say that $\mathfrak{M}$ is $<\!\!\kappa$-presented if it is $<\!\!\kappa$-generated, and the kernel of the quotient map is also $<\!\!\kappa$-generated. We say finitely or countably generated (or presented) if $\kappa$ is $\omega$ or $\omega_{1}$, respectively.
Definition 2.2.5. Let $\mu:\mathfrak{M}_{0}\times\mathbold{Z}\xrightarrow{}\mathbold{Z}$ be an $\mathfrak{M}_{0}$-scheme, and let $\mathbold{W}$ be a quasi-projective scheme over $\mathbold{Z}$. The $\mathbold{Z}$-prolongation of $\mathbold{W}$ is the pro-scheme $\tau(\mathbold{W})=p_{*}(\mu^{*}(\mathbold{W}))$ over $\mathbold{Z}$, where $p$ is the projection $p:\mathfrak{M}:=\mathfrak{M}_{0}\times\mathbold{Z}\xrightarrow{}\mathbold{Z}$. The base point of $\mathfrak{M}_{0}$ determines a map $\pi^{\tau}_{\mathbold}{W}:\tau(\mathbold{W})\xrightarrow{}\mathbold{W}$.
Definition 1.1.3. Let $\Bbbk$ be a field. By a $\Bbbk$-linear category we mean an additive category $\mathcal{C}$, together with a $\Bbbk$-vector space structure on each abelian group $\operatorname{Hom}(\mathit{X},\mathit{Y})$, such that (1) Composition is $\Bbbk$-bilinear. (2) Each $\operatorname{Hom}(\mathit{X},\mathit{Y})$ is finite dimensional (3) Each object has finite length (i.e., the length of a strictly descending chain starting from a given object is bounded).
Definition 1.1.9. An $E$-module $\mathit{X}$ in $\mathcal{C}$ is flat if the functor $M\mapsto{}M\otimes_{E}\mathit{X}$ from $(E)_{coh}$ to $\mathcal{C}$ is exact. We denote by $\mathcal{C}_{(E)}$ the full sub-category of $E\!-\!\mathcal{C}$ consisting of flat $E$-modules.
Definition 1.2.8. Let $\Bbbk$ be a field, $\mathcal{C}$ a rigid abelian $\Bbbk$-linear tensor category, and $E$ a quasi-separable $\Bbbk$-algebra (Remark 1.1.17). An object $\mathit{X}$ of $E\!-\!\mathcal{C}$ will be called $E$-injective if ${{\mathit{X}}^{\vee}}$ is $E$-flat. The $E$-prolongation of $\mathcal{C}$, $\mathcal{C}^{(E)}$, is defined to be the full tensor sub-category of $\mathcal{C}^{E}$ consisting of $E$-injective modules.
Definition 2.1.1. Let $\mathbold{X}$ be a quasi-compact Noetherian scheme. By a formal set over $\mathbold{X}$, we mean an ind-object in the category of flat, finite schemes over $\mathbold{X}$ (i.e., schemes over $\mathbold{X}$ whose sheaf of algebras is flat and coherent as an $\mathbold{X}$-module). The formal set is strict if it can be represented by a system of closed embeddings. It is quasi-separable if it can be represented by a system of quasi-separable schemes over $\mathbold{X}$. A pointed formal set is a formal set $\mathfrak{M}$ together with a map $\mathbold{X}\xrightarrow{}\mathfrak{M}$ over $\mathbold{X}$. A formal (abelian) monoid (etc.) over $\mathbold{X}$ is an (abelian) monoid object in this category.
Definition 3.2.8. Let $\mathcal{C}$ be an $E_{0}$-tensor category. An $E_{0}$-fibre functor on $\mathcal{C}$ is an $E_{0}$-tensor functor from $\mathcal{C}$ to $\mathpzc{Vec}_{\Bbbk}$, where the latter has the $E_{0}$-structure corresponding to the action recovered from $\mathcal{C}$. An $E_{0}$-Tannakian category is an $E_{0}$-tensor category that admits an $E_{0}$-fibre functor. More generally, if $K$ is an $\mathfrak{M}$-field extension of $\Bbbk$, an $E_{0}$-fibre functor over $K$ is an $E_{0}$-tensor functor from $\mathcal{C}$ to $\mathpzc{Vec}_{K}$, with the corresponding $E_{0}$-structure.
Definition 1.1.6. Let $E$ be an associative $\Bbbk$-algebra. A (left) $E$-module in $\mathcal{C}$ is an object $\mathit{X}$ of $\mathcal{C}$, together with a $\Bbbk$-algebra map $E\xrightarrow{}{}\operatorname{End}(\mathit{X})$. We denote by $E\!-\!\mathcal{C}$ the category of left $E$-modules in $\mathcal{C}$ (with $E$-action preserving maps).
Definition 4.11. The subcategory $\mathcal{C}^{r}_{R}$ of $\operatorname{mod}R$ is defined inductively as follows. (1) Every module of finite projective dimension belongs to $\mathcal{C}^{r}_{R}$. (2) A module $M$ with $0<\operatorname{{\sf cx}}_{R}M<\infty$ belongs to $\mathcal{C}^{r}_{R}$ if there exists a homogeneous element $\eta\in\operatorname{Ext}_{R}^{*}(M,M)$ with $|\eta|>0$ which is represented by a short exact sequence $0\to{M}\to{K}\to{\mathrm{\Omega}^{|\eta|-1}M}\to 0$ with $K\in\mathcal{C}^{r}_{R}$, $\operatorname{{\sf cx}}K<\operatorname{{\sf cx}}M$ and $\operatorname{{\sf depth}}K=\operatorname{{\sf depth}}M$. An $R$-module is said to have reducible complexity if it is in $\mathcal{C}^{r}_{R}$.
Definition 1.4. An $R$-module $M$ is called totally reflexive if the natural homomorphism $M\to M^{**}$ is an isomorphism and $\operatorname{Ext}_{R}^{i}(M,R)=0=\operatorname{Ext}_{R}^{i}(M^{*},R)$ for all $i>0$. We denote by $\operatorname{\mathcal{G}}(R)$ the subcategory of $\operatorname{mod}R$ consisting of totally reflexive modules.
Definition 1.6. A subcategory $\mathcal{X}$ of $\operatorname{\mathcal{G}}(R)$ is called thick if it is closed under direct summands, and short exact sequences: for an exact sequence $0\to L\to M\to N\to 0$ of totally reflexive $R$-modules, if two of $L,M,N$ are in $\mathcal{X}$, then so is the third.
Definition 5.2. For a subcategory $\mathcal{X}$ of $\operatorname{mod}$ we define $\operatorname{\mathsf{size}}\mathcal{X}$ (respectively, $\operatorname{\mathsf{rank}}\mathcal{X}$) to be the infimum of integers $n\geq 0$ such that $\mathcal{X}\subseteq|G|_{n+1}$ (respectively, $\mathcal{X}=|G|_{n+1}$) for some $G\in\operatorname{mod}R$.
Definition 2.1. Let $R$ be a local ring. (1) For a subcategory $\mathcal{X}$ of $\operatorname{mod}R$ we denote by $[\mathcal{X}]$ the additive closure of the subcategory of $\operatorname{mod}R$ consisting of $R$ and all modules of the form $\mathrm{\Omega}^{i}X$, where $i\geq 0$ and $X\in\mathcal{X}$. When $\mathcal{X}$ consists of a single module $X$, we simply denote it by $[X]$. (2) For subcategories $\mathcal{X},\mathcal{Y}$ of $\operatorname{mod}R$ we denote by $\mathcal{X}\circ\mathcal{Y}$ the subcategory of $\operatorname{mod}R$ consisting of the $R$-modules $M$ which fits into an exact sequence $0\to X\to M\to Y\to 0$ with $X\in\mathcal{X}$ and $Y\in\mathcal{Y}$. We set $\mathcal{X}\bullet\mathcal{Y}=[[\mathcal{X}]\circ[\mathcal{Y}]]$. (3) Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a subcategory of $\operatorname{mod}R$. We define the ball of radius $r$ centered at $\mathcal{C}$ as $[\mathcal{C}]_{r}=\begin{cases}[\mathcal{C}]&(r=1),\\ _{r-1}\bullet\mathcal{C}=[[\mathcal{C}]_{r-1}\circ[\mathcal{C}]]&(r\geq 2).% \end{cases}$ If $\mathcal{C}$ consists of a single module $C$, then we simply denote $[\mathcal{C}]_{r}$ by $[C]_{r}$, and call it the ball of radius $r$ centered at $C$. We write $[\mathcal{C}]_{r}^{R}$ when we should specify that $\operatorname{mod}R$ is the ground category where the ball is defined.
Definition 1.5. Let $(R,\mathfrak{m})$ be a local ring, and let $M$ be an $R$-module. (1) Take a minimal free resolution $\cdots\xrightarrow{\delta_{n+1}}F_{n}\xrightarrow{\delta_{n}}F_{n-1}% \xrightarrow{\delta_{n-1}}\cdots\xrightarrow{\delta_{1}}F_{0}\to M\to 0$ of $M$. Then, for each $n\geq 1$, the image of $\delta_{n}$ is called the $n$-th syzygy of $M$ and denoted by $\mathrm{\Omega}^{n}M$ (or $\mathrm{\Omega}_{R}^{n}M$). For convention, we set $\mathrm{\Omega}^{0}M=M$. (2) The cokernel of the $R$-dual map $\delta_{1}^{*}:F_{0}^{*}\to F_{1}^{*}$ is called the (Auslander) transpose of $M$ and denoted by $\mathrm{Tr}M$ (or $\mathrm{Tr}_{R}M$). (3) Let $0\to M\to F_{-1}\xrightarrow{\delta_{-1}}\cdots\xrightarrow{\delta_{-(n-1)}}F_% {-n}\xrightarrow{\delta_{-n}}F_{-(n+1)}\xrightarrow{\delta_{-(n+1)}}\cdots$ be a minimal free coresolution of $M$, that is, an exact sequence with $F_{-n}$ free and $\operatorname{Im}\delta_{-n}\subseteq\mathfrak{m}F_{-(n+1)}$ for all $n\geq 1$. Then we call the image of $\delta_{-n}$ the $n$-th cosyzygy of $M$ and denote it by $\mathrm{\Omega}^{-n}M$ (or $\mathrm{\Omega}_{R}^{-n}M$).
Definition 2.3. Let $R$ be a local ring, and let $\mathcal{X}$ be a subcategory of $\operatorname{mod}R$. We define the radius of $\mathcal{X}$, denoted by $\operatorname{{\sf radius}}\mathcal{X}$, as the infimum of the integers $n\geq 0$ such that there exists a ball of radius $n+1$ centered at a module containing $\mathcal{X}$. By definition, $\operatorname{{\sf radius}}\mathcal{X}\in\mathbb{N}\cup\{\infty\}$.
Definition 1.3. A subcategory $\mathcal{X}$ of $\operatorname{mod}R$ is called resolving if the following hold. (R1) $\mathcal{X}$ contains the projective $R$-modules. (R2) $\mathcal{X}$ is closed under direct summands: if $M$ is an $R$-module in $\mathcal{X}$ and $N$ is an $R$-module that is a direct summand of $M$, then $N$ is also in $\mathcal{X}$. (R3) $\mathcal{X}$ is closed under extensions: for an exact sequence $0\to L\to M\to N\to 0$ of $R$-modules, if $L,N$ are in $\mathcal{X}$, then so is $M$. (R4) $\mathcal{X}$ is closed under kernels of epimorphisms: for an exact sequence $0\to L\to M\to N\to 0$ of $R$-modules, if $M,N$ are in $\mathcal{X}$, then so is $L$.
Definition 1.8. Let $R$ be a local ring, and let $M$ be an $R$-module. The G-dimension of $M$, denoted $\operatorname{{\sf Gdim}}_{R}M$, is defined as the infimum of the lengths of totally reflexive resolutions of $M$, namely, exact sequences of the form $0\to X_{n}\to X_{n-1}\to\cdots\to X_{1}\to X_{0}\to M\to 0$ with each $X_{i}$ being totally reflexive. The CI-dimension of $M$ is defined as the infimum of $\operatorname{{\sf pd}}_{S}(M\otimes_{R}R^{\prime})-\operatorname{{\sf pd}}_{S% }R^{\prime}$ where $R\to R^{\prime}\leftarrow S$ runs over the quasi-deformations of $R$. Here, a diagram $R\overset{f}{\to}R^{\prime}\overset{g}{\leftarrow}S$ of homomorphisms of local rings is called a quasi-deformation of $R$ if $f$ is faithfully flat and $g$ is a surjection whose kernel is generated by an $S$-sequence.
Definition 5.1. Let $\mathcal{X},\mathcal{Y}$ be subcategories of $\operatorname{mod}R$. We put $|\mathcal{X}|=\operatorname{add}\mathcal{X}$, and set $\mathcal{X}*\mathcal{Y}=||\mathcal{X}|\circ|\mathcal{Y}||$. (The notation “$\circ$” was introduced in Definition 2.1.) For an integer $r>0$, set $|\mathcal{X}|_{r}=\begin{cases}|\mathcal{X}|&(r=1),\\ |\mathcal{X}|_{r-1}*\mathcal{X}&(r\geq 2).\end{cases}$
Definition 7.1. We say that two labeled Feynman graphs $\Gamma_{1}$ and $\Gamma_{2}$ are isomorphic if there exist bijections $f_{V}:V(\Gamma_{1})\rightarrow V(\Gamma_{2})$, $f_{H}:H(\Gamma_{1})\rightarrow H(\Gamma_{2})$ which induce bijections on all incidences. We write $f:\Gamma_{1}\cong\Gamma_{2}$.
Definition 6.3. (1) A Feynman graph is a graph where each vertex is incident to exactly three half-edges, and each connected component has $2$ or $3$ external edges. We denote the set of Feynman graphs by $FG$. (2) Similarly, we can define a labeled Feynman graph. We denote the set of labeled Feynman graphs by $LFG$. (3) A graph (or a labeled graph) is 1-particle irreducible ($1\operatorname{PI}$) if it is connected, and remains connected under the removal of an arbitrary internal edge.
Definition 6.1. A graph $\Gamma$ consists of a set $H=H(\Gamma)$ of half-edges, a set $V=V(\Gamma)$ of vertices, a set of vertex-half edge adjacency relations $(\subset V\times H)$, and a set of half edge - half edge adjacency relations $(\subset H\times H)$, with the requirements that each half edge is adjacent to at most one other half edge and to exactly one vertex. Note that graphs may not be connected. Half edges which are not adjacent to another half edge are called external edges, and denoted $Ex=Ex(\Gamma)\subset E=E(\Gamma)$. Pairs of adjacent half edges are called internal edges, and denoted $Int(\Gamma)$.
Definition 6.5. Let $\Gamma$ be a Feynman graph, and $\gamma\subset\Gamma$ a connected subgraph. The quotient graph $\Gamma/\gamma$ is defined as follows. If $\gamma$ has $3$ external edges, then $\Gamma/\gamma$ is the Feynman graph with (1) $V(\Gamma/\gamma)$ set the vertex set of $\Gamma$ with all vertices of $\gamma$ removed, and a new trivalent vertex $v$ added. (2) $H(\Gamma/\gamma)$ the half edge set of $\Gamma$, with all half edges corresponding to internal half edges of $\gamma$ removed. (3) All adjacencies inherited from $\Gamma$, and the external half edges of $\gamma$ joined to $v$. If $\gamma$ has $2$ external edges, then $\Gamma/\gamma$ is the Feynman graph with (1) $V(\Gamma/\gamma)$ is $V(\Gamma)$ with all the vertices of $\gamma$ removed. (2) $H(\Gamma/\gamma)$ is $H(\Gamma)$ with all half edges of $\gamma$ removed. (3) All adjacencies inherited from $\Gamma$, as well as the adjacency of the external half-edges of $\gamma$. Finally, If $\gamma\subset\Gamma$ is an arbitrary (not necessarily connected) Feynman subgraph, then $\Gamma/\gamma$ is defined to be the Feynman graph obtained by performing successive quotients by each connected component. Note that the order of collapsing does not matter.
Definition 4.1. We say that two labeled rooted trees $T_{1}$ and $T_{2}$ are isomorphic, and write $f:T_{1}\cong T_{2}$ if there exists a root and incidence-preserving bijection $f:\emph{lab}(T_{1})\rightarrow\emph{lab}(T_{2})$. Two forests $F_{1}:=\{T_{1},\cdots,T_{n}\}$ and $F_{2}:=\{U_{1},\cdots,U_{n}\}$ are isomorphic if $f:T_{i}\cong U_{i}$ for $i=1,\cdots,n$. We write $f:F_{1}\cong F_{2}$
Definition 6.2. A half edge $S$–labeled graph, (labeled graph for short), is a triple $(\Gamma,S,\rho)$, where $\Gamma$ is a graph, $S$ is a set such that $|S|=|H|$, and $\rho:H\rightarrow S$ is a bijection. $S$ will usually be obvious from context.
Definition 6.6. Let $\Gamma_{1},\Gamma_{2}\in LFG$. If $\Gamma_{1}$ has three external edges, $v\in V(\Gamma_{2})$, and $f:Ex(\Gamma_{1})\rightarrow H(v)$ is a bijection (where $H(v)$ are the labeled half-edges incident to the vertex $v$), then let $\Gamma_{2}\circ_{v,f}\Gamma_{1}$ be the labeled Feynman graph such that • $V(\Gamma_{2}\circ_{v,f}\Gamma_{1})=V(\Gamma_{2})\cup V(\Gamma_{1})\backslash v$. • $H(\Gamma_{2}\circ_{v,f}\Gamma_{1})=H(\Gamma_{1})\cup_{f}H(\Gamma_{2})$ - i.e. the unions of the half-edges of each graph, with the identifications induced by $f$. • The adjacencies induced from those of $\Gamma_{1}$ and $\Gamma_{2}$. If $\Gamma_{1}$ has two external edges, $\{e_{1},e_{2}\}\in Int(\Gamma_{2})\subset H\times H$, and $f$ is a bijection between $Ex(\Gamma_{1})$ and $\{e_{1},e_{2}\}$ (there are two of these), then $\Gamma_{2}\circ_{e,f}\Gamma_{1}$ is the labeled Feynman graph such that • $V(\Gamma_{2}\circ_{e,f}\Gamma_{1})=V(\Gamma_{1})\cup V(\Gamma_{2})$. • $H(\Gamma_{2}\circ_{e,f}\Gamma_{1})=H(\Gamma_{1})\cup H(\Gamma_{2})$. • The adjacency induced by $f$ as well as those induced from $\Gamma_{1}$ and $\Gamma_{2}$. Let $\mathfrak{n}_{LFG}$ denote the $\mathbb{Q}$–vector space spanned by unlabeled Feynman graphs. Given a labeled Feynman graph $\Gamma$, denote by $\overline{\Gamma}$ the corresponding unlabeled Feynman graph. Thus, $\mathfrak{n}_{LFG}=\mathbb{Q}\{LFG\}/\sim$ where $\Gamma\sim\Gamma^{\prime}$ iff $\overline{\Gamma}=\overline{\Gamma^{\prime}}$. We now equip $\mathfrak{n}_{LFG}$ with the pre-Lie product ”$\star$”, defined by $\overline{\Gamma_{1}}\star\overline{\Gamma_{2}}:=\sum_{v\in V(\Gamma_{2}),\\ f:Ex(\Gamma_{1})\rightarrow H(v)}\overline{\Gamma_{2}\circ_{v,f}\Gamma_{1}}$ if $\Gamma_{1}$ has three external edges, and $\overline{\Gamma_{1}}\star\overline{\Gamma_{2}}:=\sum_{e\in Int(\Gamma_{2}),\\ f:Ex(\Gamma_{1})\rightarrow\{e_{1},e_{2}\}}\overline{\Gamma_{2}\circ_{v,f}% \Gamma_{1}}$ if $\Gamma_{1}$ has two external edges, and extended linearly ( in the above formulas, we first choose an arbitrary labeling of the Feynman graphs). Finally, we can define the Lie bracket on $\mathfrak{n}_{LFG}$ by $[\overline{\Gamma_{1}},\overline{\Gamma_{2}}]:=\overline{\Gamma_{1}}\star% \overline{\Gamma_{2}}-\overline{\Gamma_{2}}\star\overline{\Gamma_{1}}$
Definition 3.1. By a subforest of a labeled rooted forest $F$ we mean a forest of the form $G=P_{C}(F)$, for an admissible cut $C$. We write $G\subset F$.
Definition 6.4. Given a Feynman graph $\Gamma$, a subgraph $\gamma$ is a Feynman graph such that $V(\gamma)\subset V(\Gamma)$, $H(\gamma)\subset H(\Gamma)$, and such that if $v\in V(\gamma)$, and $(v,e)\in V(\Gamma)\times H(\Gamma)$, then $e\in H(\gamma)$ (i.e. the subgraph has to contain all half-edges incident to its vertices). We also insist that $\operatorname{dim}_{\mathbb{Q}}(H_{1}(\gamma,\mathbb{Q}))>0$ (i.e. that a subgraph contain at least one loop). We write $\gamma\subset\Gamma$. The same definition applies to labeled graphs.
Definition 3.2. Let $(\mathcal{T},\otimes,\iota,\varepsilon)$ be a symmetric tensor C*-category. An embedding functor is a C*-monofunctor $E:\mathcal{T}\to{\bf vect}(X^{\iota})$ preserving tensor product and symmetry.
Definition 3.6. A special category is a locally trivial, symmetric tensor C*-category $(\widehat{\rho},\otimes,\iota,\varepsilon)$ with fibre $(\widehat{\rho}_{\bullet},\otimes_{\bullet},\iota_{\bullet},\varepsilon_{% \bullet})$, such that $\rho_{\bullet}$ is a special object.
Definition 3.3. The faithful representation $G\subseteq{{\mathbb{U}}(d)}$ is said to be covariant whenever for each $\eta\in{\bf emb}\mathcal{O}_{G}$ there is $u\in{{\mathbb{U}}(d)}$ such that $\eta=\widehat{u}|_{\mathcal{O}_{G}}$.
Definition 3.1. The extension of $(L,\eta)$ over $\mathcal{E}^{C}$ away from a subset $J\subseteq C$ is the coaugmented functor on $\mathcal{E}^{C}$ —which we keep denoting by $(L,\eta)$ if no confusion can arise— given by $L{\bf X}=(L_{c}X(c))_{c\in C}$ where $L_{c}$ is the identity functor if $c\in J$ and $L_{c}=L$ if $c\not\in J$. Correspondingly, $\eta_{{\bf X}}\colon{\bf X}\longrightarrow L{\bf X}$ is defined by declaring that $(\eta_{{\bf X}})_{c}$ is the identity map if $c\in J$ and $(\eta_{{\bf X}})_{c}=\eta_{X(c)}$ if $c\not\in J$.
Definition 4.1. A homotopical localization on a model category $\mathcal{M}$ with homotopy function complexes $\mathop{\textrm{\rm map}}(-,-)$ is a functor $L\colon\mathcal{M}\longrightarrow\mathcal{M}$ that preserves weak equivalences and takes fibrant values, together with a natural transformation $\eta\colon{\rm Id}_{\mathcal{M}}\longrightarrow L$ such that, for every object $X$, the following hold: (i) $L\eta_{X}\colon LX\longrightarrow LLX$ is a weak equivalence; (ii) $\eta_{LX}$ and $L\eta_{X}$ are equal in the homotopy category ${\mathrm{Ho}}(\mathcal{M})$; (iii) $\eta_{X}\colon X\longrightarrow LX$ is a cofibration such that the map $\mathop{\textrm{\rm map}}(\eta_{X},LY)\colon\mathop{\textrm{\rm map}}(LX,LY)% \longrightarrow\mathop{\textrm{\rm map}}(X,LY)$ is a weak equivalence of simplicial sets for all $Y$.
